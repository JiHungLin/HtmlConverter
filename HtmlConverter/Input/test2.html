<br />You do not pay a separate monthly plan premium for Aetna Medicare Premier (PPO). You must continue to pay your Medicare Part B premium (unless your Part B premium is paid for you by Medicaid or another third party).<br /></p>
<br /><strong>In some situations, your plan premium could be <u>more</u></strong><br />In some situations, your plan premium could be more than the amount listed above in Section 4.1. These situations are described below.
<ul>
<li>Some members are required to pay a Part D <strong>late enrollment penalty</strong> because they did not join a Medicare drug plan when they first became eligible or because they had a continuous period of 63 days or more when they didn’t have “creditable” prescription drug coverage. (“Creditable" means the drug coverage is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare's standard prescription drug coverage.) For these members, the Part D late enrollment penalty is added to the plan’s monthly premium. Their premium amount will be the monthly plan premium plus the amount of their Part D late enrollment penalty.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>If you are required to pay the Part D late enrollment penalty, the cost of the late enrollment penalty depends on how long you went without Part D or other creditable prescription drug coverage. Chapter 1, Section 5 explains the Part D late enrollment penalty.</li>
<li>If you have a Part D late enrollment penalty and do not pay it, you could be disenrolled from the plan.</li>
</ul>

<strong><br />Note</strong>: If you receive “Extra Help” from Medicare to pay for your prescription drugs, you will not pay a late enrollment penalty.<br /><br />
<p>The late enrollment penalty is an amount that is added to your Part D premium. You may owe a Part D late enrollment penalty if at any time after your initial enrollment period is over, there is a period of 63 days or more in a row when you did not have Part D or other creditable prescription drug coverage. (“Creditable prescription drug coverage” is coverage that meets Medicare’s minimum standards since it is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage.) The cost of the late enrollment penalty depends on how long you went without Part D or other creditable prescription drug coverage. You will have to pay this penalty for as long as you have Part D coverage.</p>
<br />
<p>When you first enroll in Aetna Medicare Premier (PPO), we let you know the amount of the penalty. Your Part D late enrollment penalty is considered part of your plan premium.</p>

<p><br />Medicare determines the amount of the penalty. Here is how it works:</p>
<ul>
<li>First count the number of full months that you delayed enrolling in a Medicare drug plan after you were eligible to enroll. Or count the number of full months in which you did not have creditable prescription drug coverage, if the break in coverage was 63 days or more. The penalty is 1% for every month that you didn’t have creditable coverage. For example, if you go 14 months without coverage, the penalty will be 14%.</li>
<li>Then Medicare determines the amount of the average monthly premium for Medicare drug plans in the nation from the previous year. For 2021, this average premium amount was $33.06. This amount may change for 2022.</li>
<li>To calculate your monthly penalty, you multiply the penalty percentage and the average monthly premium and then round it to the nearest 10 cents. In the example here it would be 14% times $33.06, which equals $4.63. This rounds to $4.60. This amount would be added <strong>to the monthly premium for someone with a Part D late enrollment penalty.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are three important things to note about this monthly Part D late enrollment penalty:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, <strong>the penalty may change each year</strong>, because the average monthly premium can change each year. If the national average premium (as determined by Medicare) increases, your penalty will increase.</li>
<li>Second, <strong>you will continue to pay a penalty</strong> every month for as long as you are enrolled in a plan that has Medicare Part D drug benefits, even if you change plans.</li>
<li>Third, if you are <u>under</u> 65 and currently receiving Medicare benefits, the Part D late enrollment penalty will reset when you turn 65. After age 65, your Part D late enrollment penalty will be based only on the months that you don’t have coverage after your initial enrollment period for aging into Medicare.</li>

<p><br />Even if you have delayed enrolling in a plan offering Medicare Part D coverage when you were first eligible, sometimes you do not have to pay the Part D late enrollment penalty.</p>
<br />
<p><strong>You will not have to pay a penalty for late enrollment if you are in any of these situations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you already have prescription drug coverage that is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage. Medicare calls this “<strong>creditable drug coverage.</strong>” <u>Please note</u>:
<ul>
<li>Creditable coverage could include drug coverage from a former employer or union, TRICARE, or the Department of Veterans Affairs. Your insurer or your human resources department will tell you each year if your drug coverage is creditable coverage. This information may be sent to you in a letter or included in a newsletter from the plan. Keep this information, because you may need it if you join a Medicare drug plan later.
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Please note: If you receive a “certificate of creditable coverage” when your health coverage ends, it may not mean your prescription drug coverage was creditable. The notice must state that you had “creditable” prescription drug coverage that expected to pay as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug plan pays.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The following are <em>not</em> creditable prescription drug coverage: prescription drug discount cards, free clinics, and drug discount websites.</li>
<li>For additional information about creditable coverage, please look in your <em>Medicare & You 2022</em> Handbook or call Medicare at 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users call 1-877-486-2048. You can call these numbers for free, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you were without creditable coverage, but you were without it for less than 63 days in a row.</li>
<li>If you are receiving “Extra Help” from Medicare.</li>

<p><br /><strong>No</strong>. We are not allowed to begin charging a monthly plan premium during the year.

(The late enrollment penalty may apply if you had a continuous period of 63 days or more when you didn’t have “creditable” prescription drug coverage.) This could happen if you become eligible for the “Extra Help” program or if you lose your eligibility for the “Extra Help” program during the year:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you currently pay the Part D late enrollment penalty and become eligible for “Extra Help” during the year, you would be able to stop paying your penalty.</li>
<li>If you lose your Extra Help, you may be subject to the late enrollment penalty if you go 63 days or more in a row without Part D or other creditable prescription drug coverage.</li>

<p><br />When you have other insurance (like employer group health coverage), there are rules set by Medicare that decide whether our plan or your other insurance pays first. The insurance that pays first is called the “primary payer” and pays up to the limits of its coverage. The one that pays second, called the “secondary payer,” only pays if there are costs left uncovered by the primary coverage. The secondary payer may not pay all of the uncovered costs.</p>
<br />These rules apply for employer or union group health plan coverage:<br />
<ul>
<li>If you have retiree coverage, Medicare pays first.</li>
<li>If your group health plan coverage is based on your or a family member’s current employment, who pays first depends on your age, the number of people employed by your employer, and whether you have Medicare based on age, disability, or End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD):
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>If you’re under 65 and disabled and you or your family member is still working, your group health plan pays first if the employer has 100 or more employees or at least one employer in a multiple employer plan that has more than 100 employees.</li>
<li>If you’re over 65 and you or your spouse is still working, your group health plan pays first if the employer has 20 or more employees or at least one employer in a multiple employer plan that has more than 20 employees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you have Medicare because of ESRD, your group health plan will pay first for the first 30 months after you become eligible for Medicare.</li>
</ul>
<div>These types of coverage usually pay first for services related to each type:</div>
<ul>
<li>No-fault insurance (including automobile insurance)</li>
<li>Liability (including automobile insurance)</li>
<li>Black lung benefits</li>
<li>Workers’ compensation</li>
</ul>
<p>Medicaid and TRICARE never pay first for Medicare-covered services. They only pay after Medicare, employer group health plans, and/or Medigap have paid.<br /><br />If you have other insurance, tell your doctor, hospital, and pharmacy. If you have questions about who pays first, or you need to update your other insurance information, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). You may need to give your plan member ID number to your other insurers (once you have confirmed their identity) so your bills are paid correctly and on time.</p>  <div class="TOCChapter" style="text-align: right;"><strong><span style="font-size: 24pt;">CHAPTER 2<br /></span></strong><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><em>   Important phone numbers and resources</em></span></div>

<br />
<p>In addition, there are programs offered through Medicaid that help people with Medicare pay their Medicare costs, such as their Medicare premiums. These “Medicare Savings Programs” help people with limited income and resources save money each year:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB):</strong> Helps pay Medicare Part A and Part B premiums, and other cost-sharing (like deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments). (Some people with QMB are also eligible for full Medicaid benefits (QMB+).)</li>

<p><br /><strong>Medicare’s “Extra Help” Program</strong><br /><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">Medicare provides “Extra Help” to pay prescription drug costs for people who have limited income and resources. Resources include your savings and stocks, but not your home or car. If you qualify, you get help paying for any Medicare drug plan’s monthly premium, yearly deductible, and prescription copayments. This “Extra Help” also counts toward your out-of-pocket costs.<br /><br /></span></p>
<p>Some people automatically qualify for “Extra Help” and don’t need to apply. Medicare mails a letter to people who automatically qualify for “Extra Help.”<br /><br />You may be able to get “Extra Help” to pay for your prescription drug premiums and costs. To see if you qualify for getting “Extra Help,” call:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227). TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week;</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The Social Security Office at 1-800-772-1213, between 7 am to 7 pm, Monday through Friday. TTY users should call 1-800-325-0778 (applications); or</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Your State Medicaid Office (applications). (See <strong>Addendum A</strong> at the back of this booklet for contact information.)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe you have qualified for “Extra Help” and you believe that you are paying an incorrect cost-sharing amount when you get your prescription at a pharmacy, our plan has established a process that allows you to either request assistance in obtaining evidence of your proper copayment level, or, if you already have the evidence, to provide this evidence to us.

If you overpay your copayment, we will reimburse you. Either we will forward a check to you in the amount of your overpayment or we will offset future copayments. If the pharmacy hasn’t collected a copayment from you and is carrying your copayment as a debt owed by you, we may make the payment directly to the pharmacy.

<strong style="font-size: 14.6667px;">Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program</strong><br style="font-size: 14.6667px;" />
<p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">The Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program provides manufacturer discounts on brand name drugs to Part D members who have reached the coverage gap and are not receiving “Extra Help.” For brand name drugs, the 70% discount provided by manufacturers excludes any dispensing fee for costs in the gap. Members pay 25% of the negotiated price and a portion of the dispensing fee for brand name drugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><br />If you reach the coverage gap, we will automatically apply the discount when your pharmacy bills you for your prescription and your <em>Part D Explanation of Benefits</em> (Part D EOB) will show any discount provided. Both the amount you pay and the amount discounted by the manufacturer count toward your out-of-pocket costs as if you had paid them and move you through the coverage gap. The amount paid by the plan (5%) does not count toward your out-of-pocket costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><br />You also receive some coverage for generic drugs. If you reach the coverage gap, the plan pays 75% of the price for generic drugs and you pay the remaining 25% of the price. For generic drugs, the amount paid by the plan (75%) does not count toward your out-of-pocket costs. Only the amount you pay counts and moves you through the coverage gap. Also, the dispensing fee is included as part of the cost of the drug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><br />The Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program is available nationwide. Because Aetna Medicare Premier (PPO) offers additional gap coverage during the Coverage Gap Stage, your out-of-pocket costs will sometimes be lower than the costs described here. Please go to Chapter 6, Section 6 for more information about your coverage during the Coverage Gap Stage.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><br />If you have any questions about the availability of discounts for the drugs you are taking or about the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program in general, please contact Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).<br /><br /></span></p>

<p><strong>What if you have coverage from a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program (SPAP)?</strong><br />If you are enrolled in a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program (SPAP), or any other program that provides coverage for Part D drugs (other than “Extra Help”), you still get the 70% discount on covered brand name drugs. Also, the plan pays 5% of the costs of brand drugs in the coverage gap. The 70% discount and the 5% paid by the plan are both applied to the price of the drug before any SPAP or other coverage.</p>
<div> </div>

<p><strong style="font-size: 11pt;">What if you have coverage from an AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP)?</strong></p>
<strong>What is the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP)?<br /></strong>
<p style="font-size: 14.6667px;">The AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) helps ADAP-eligible individuals living with HIV/AIDS have access to life-saving HIV medications. Medicare Part D prescription drugs that are also covered by ADAP qualify for prescription cost-sharing assistance (telephone numbers are in <strong>Addendum A</strong> at the back of this booklet). Note: To be eligible for the ADAP operating in your State, individuals must meet certain criteria, including proof of State residence and HIV status, low income as defined by the State, and uninsured/under-insured status.<br /><br />If you are currently enrolled in an ADAP, it can continue to provide you with Medicare Part D prescription cost-sharing assistance for drugs on the ADAP formulary. In order to be sure you continue receiving this assistance, please notify your local ADAP enrollment worker of any changes in your Medicare Part D plan name or policy number. Refer to <strong>Addendum A</strong> at the back of this booklet for the name and contact information of the ADAP in your state.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<strong>What if you get “Extra Help” from Medicare to help pay your prescription drug costs?</strong><br /><strong>Can you get the discounts?<br /></strong>
<p>No. If you get “Extra Help,” you already get coverage for your prescription drug costs during the coverage gap.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><br /><strong style="font-size: 14.6667px;">What if you don’t get a discount, and you think you should have?</strong><br style="font-size: 14.6667px;" /><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If you think that you have reached the coverage gap and did not get a discount when you paid for your brand name drug, you should review your next </span><em style="font-size: 14.6667px;">Part D Explanation of Benefits</em><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"> (Part D EOB) notice. If the discount doesn’t appear on your </span><em style="font-size: 14.6667px;">Part D Explanation of Benefits</em><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">, you should contact us to make sure that your prescription records are correct and up-to-date. If we don’t agree that you are owed a discount, you can appeal. You can get help filing an appeal from your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) (telephone numbers are in </span><strong style="font-size: 14.6667px;">Addendum A</strong><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"> at the back of this booklet) or by calling 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.</span><br /><p><br /><strong>State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs<br /></strong>Many states have State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs that help some people pay for prescription drugs based on financial need, age, medical condition, or disabilities. Each state has different rules to provide drug coverage to its members.<br /><br />Refer to <strong>Addendum A</strong> at the back of this booklet for the name and contact information of the State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program in your state.</p></span></p>

We have arranged for these providers to deliver covered services to members in our plan. The providers in our network bill us directly for care they give you. When you see a network provider, you pay only your share of the cost for their services. </li>

<br />As a Medicare health plan, Aetna Medicare Premier (PPO) must cover all services covered by Original Medicare and must follow Original Medicare’s coverage rules.<br /><br />Aetna Medicare Premier (PPO) will generally cover your medical care as long as: <br /><ul>
<li><strong>The care you receive is included in the plan’s Medical Benefits Chart</strong> (this chart is in Chapter 4 of this booklet).</li>
<li><strong>The care you receive is considered medically necessary.</strong> “Medically necessary” means that the services, supplies, or drugs are needed for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of your medical condition and meet accepted standards of medical practice.</li>

<li><strong>You receive your care from a provider who is eligible to provide services under Original Medicare.</strong> As a member of our plan, you can receive your care from either a network provider or an out-of-network provider (for more about this, see Section 2 in this chapter).
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>The providers in our network are listed in the <em>Provider</em><em> & Pharmacy</em> <em>Directory.</em></li>
<li>If you use an out-of-network provider, your share of the costs for your covered services may be higher.</li>
<li><strong>Please note:</strong> While you can get your care from an out-of-network provider, the provider must be eligible to participate in Medicare. Except for emergency care, we cannot pay a provider who is not eligible to participate in Medicare. If you go to a provider who is not eligible to participate in Medicare, you will be responsible for the full cost of the services you receive. Check with your provider before receiving services to confirm that they are eligible to participate in Medicare.</li>

<br /><strong>What is a “PCP” and what does the PCP do for you?<br /></strong>As a member of our plan, you do not have to choose a network PCP, <strong>however</strong>, <strong>we strongly encourage you to choose a PCP and let us know who you chose.</strong> Your PCP can help you stay healthy, treat illnesses and coordinate your care with other health care providers.  <br /><br />
<div><strong style="font-size: 11pt;">Depending on where you live, the following types of providers may act as a PCP:</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>General Practitioner </li>
<li>Internist </li>
<li>Family Practitioner </li>
<li>Geriatrician</li>
<li>Physician Assistants (Not available in all states)</li>
<li>Nurse Practitioners (Not available in all states)</li>
</ul>
<p>Please refer to your <em>Provider <em>& Pharmacy</em> <em>Directory</em></em> or go to our website at <a href="AetnaMedicare.com/findprovider" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AetnaMedicare.com/findprovider</a> for a complete listing of PCPs in your area.</p>
<br /><strong>What is the role of a PCP in coordinating covered services?</strong><br />Your PCP will provide most of your care, and when you need more specialized services, they will coordinate your care with other providers. They will help you find a specialist and will arrange for covered services you get as a member of our plan. Some of the services that the PCP will coordinate include: <br />
<ul>
<li>x-rays;</li>
<li>laboratory tests; </li>
<li>therapies;</li>
<li>care from doctors who are specialists; and</li>
<li>hospital admissions</li>
</ul>
“Coordinating” your services includes consulting with other plan providers about your care and how it is progressing. Since your PCP will provide and coordinate most of your medical care, we recommend that you have your past medical records sent to your PCP’s office. <br /><br /><strong>What is the role of the PCP in making decisions about or obtaining prior authorization?</strong><br />In some cases, your PCP or other provider may need to get approval in advance from our Medical Management Department for certain types of services or tests (this is called getting “prior authorization”). Services and items requiring prior authorization are listed in Chapter 4.<br /><br /><strong>How do you choose your PCP?</strong><br />
<p>You can select your PCP by using the <em>Provider <em>& Pharmacy</em> <em>Directory</em></em>, by accessing our website at <a href="AetnaMedicare.com/findprovider">AetnaMedicare.com/findprovider,</a> or getting help from Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). <br /><br /></p>
 You can change your PCP (as explained later in this section) for any reason, and at any time, by contacting Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) with your PCP choice.<strong><br /><br />Changing your PCP</strong><br />You may change your PCP for any reason, at any time. Also, it’s possible that your PCP might leave our plan’s network of providers and you would have to find a new PCP in our plan or you will pay more for covered services.<br /><br />To change your PCP, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) <strong>before</strong> you set up an appointment with a new PCP. When you call, be sure to tell Member Services if you are seeing specialists or currently getting other covered services that were coordinated by your PCP (such as home health services and durable medical equipment). They will check to see if the PCP you want to switch to is accepting new patients. Member Services will change your membership record to show the name of your new PCP, let you know the effective date of your change request, and answer your questions about the change.<br /><br />

<br />A specialist is a doctor who provides health care services for a specific disease or part of the body. There are many kinds of specialists. Here are a few examples:<br />
<ul>
<li>Oncologists care for patients with cancer.</li>
<li>Cardiologists care for patients with heart conditions.</li>
<li>Orthopedists care for patients with certain bone, joint, or muscle conditions.</li>
</ul>
<strong>What is the role of the PCP in referring members to specialists and other providers?</strong> <br />If you choose to select a PCP, your PCP will provide most of your care and will help arrange or coordinate the rest of the covered services you get as a plan member. <br />Your PCP may refer you to a specialist, but you can go to any specialists in our network without a referral. Please refer to the <em>Provider <em>& Pharmacy</em> <em>Directory</em></em> or access our website at <a href="AetnaMedicare.com/findprovider">AetnaMedicare.com/findprovider</a> for a complete listing of PCPs and other participating providers in your area, or you may contact Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). <br /><br /><strong>Prior authorization process </strong><br />In some cases, your PCP or other provider may need to get approval in advance from our Medical Management Department for certain types of services or tests that you receive in-network (this is called getting “prior authorization”). Obtaining prior authorization is the responsibility of the PCP or treating provider. Services and items requiring prior authorization are listed in the<em> Medical Benefits Chart </em>in Chapter 4, Section 2.1.<br /><br />Prior authorization is not required for covered services received out-of-network; however, if we later determine that the services you received were not covered or were not medically necessary, we may deny coverage and you will be responsible for the entire cost. You or your doctor may ask for a pre-visit coverage decision to confirm that the services you are getting are covered and are medically necessary by calling Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).<br /><br />
<p><strong>What if a specialist or another network provider leaves our plan?<br /></strong>We may make changes to the hospitals, doctors, and specialists (providers) that are part of your plan during the year. There are a number of reasons why your provider might leave your plan, but if your doctor or specialist does leave your plan you have certain rights and protections that are summarized below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though our network of providers may change during the year, Medicare requires that we furnish you with uninterrupted access to qualified doctors and specialists. </li>
<li>We will make a good faith effort to provide you with at least 30 days’ notice that your provider is leaving our plan so that you have time to select a new provider.</li>
<li>We will assist you in selecting a new qualified provider to continue managing your health care needs. </li>
<li>If you are undergoing medical treatment you have the right to request, and we will work with you to ensure, that the medically necessary treatment you are receiving is not interrupted.</li>
<li>If you believe we have not furnished you with a qualified provider to replace your previous provider or that your care is not being appropriately managed, you have the right to file an appeal of our decision. </li>
<li>If you find out your doctor or specialist is leaving your plan, please contact us so we can assist you in finding a new provider to manage your care.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may contact Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) for assistance. You may also look up participating providers using the <em>Provider <em>& Pharmacy</em> <em>Directory</em></em> or on our website at <a href="AetnaMedicare.com/findprovider">AetnaMedicare.com/findprovider</a>.</p>

<br />
<p>As a member of our plan, you can choose to receive care from out-of-network providers. However, please note providers that do not contract with us are under no obligation to treat you, except in emergency situations. Our plan will cover services from either in-network or out-of-network providers, as long as the services are covered benefits and are medically necessary. However, if you use an out-of-network provider, your share of the costs for your covered services may be higher. Here are other important things to know about using out-of-network providers:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can get your care from an out-of-network provider; however, in most cases that provider must be eligible to participate in Medicare. Except for emergency care, we cannot pay a provider who is not eligible to participate in Medicare. If you receive care from a provider who is not eligible to participate in Medicare, you will be responsible for the full cost of the services you receive. Check with your provider before receiving services to confirm that they are eligible to participate in Medicare.</li>
<li>You don’t need to get a referral or prior authorization when you get care from out-of-network providers. However, before getting services from out-of-network providers you may want to ask for a pre-visit coverage decision to confirm that the services you are getting are covered and are medically necessary. (See Chapter 9, Section 4 for information about asking for coverage decisions.) This is important because:</li>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Without a pre-visit coverage decision, if we later determine that the services are not covered or were not medically necessary, we may deny coverage and you will be responsible for the entire cost. If we say we will not cover your services, you have the right to appeal our decision not to cover your care. See Chapter 9 <em>(What to do if you have a problem or complaint)</em> to learn how to make an appeal.</li>
</ul>
<li>It is best to ask an out-of-network provider to bill the plan first. But, if you have already paid for the covered services, we will reimburse you for our share of the cost for covered services. Or if an out-of-network provider sends you a bill that you think we should pay, you can send it to us for payment. See Chapter 7 (<em>Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs</em>) for information about what to do if you receive a bill or if you need to ask for reimbursement.</li>
<li>If you are using an out-of-network provider for emergency care, urgently needed services, or out-of-area dialysis, you may not have to pay a higher cost-sharing amount. See Section 3 for more information about these situations.</li>

<strong><br />What is a “medical emergency” and what should you do if you have one?</strong>
<p>A <strong>“medical emergency”</strong> is when you, or any other prudent layperson with an average knowledge of health and medicine, believe that you have medical symptoms that require immediate medical attention to prevent loss of life, loss of a limb, or loss of function of a limb. The medical symptoms may be an illness, injury, severe pain, or a medical condition that is quickly getting worse.</p>
<p><br />If you have a medical emergency:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get help as quickly as possible.</strong> Call 911 for help or go to the nearest emergency room or hospital. Call for an ambulance if you need it. You do <em>not</em> need to get approval or a referral first from your PCP. </li>
<li><strong>As soon as possible, make sure that our plan has been told about your emergency.</strong> We need to follow up on your emergency care. You or someone else should call to tell us about your emergency care, usually within 48 hours. Please call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is covered if you have a medical emergency?</strong></p>
<p>You may get covered emergency medical care whenever you need it, anywhere in the United States or its territories. Our plan covers ambulance services in situations where getting to the emergency room in any other way could endanger your health. For more information, see the Medical Benefits Chart in Chapter 4 of this booklet.</p>
<p><br />Our plan also covers worldwide services outside of the United States under the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>Emergency care</li>

<li>Urgently needed care</li>

<li>Emergency ambulance transportation from the scene of an emergency to the nearest medical treatment facility</li>
</ul>
Transportation back to the United States from another country is not covered. Pre-scheduled and/or elective procedures are not covered. See the Medical Benefits Chart in Chapter 4 for more information.<br /><br /></p>
<br />
<p>If you have an emergency, we will talk with the doctors who are giving you emergency care to help manage and follow up on your care. The doctors who are giving you emergency care will decide when your condition is stable and the medical emergency is over.</p>
<p><br />After the emergency is over, you are entitled to follow-up care to be sure your condition continues to be stable. Your follow-up care will be covered by our plan. If you get your follow-up care from out-of-network providers, you will pay the higher out-of-network cost-sharing. <br /></p>
<p><strong><br />What if it wasn’t a medical emergency?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it can be hard to know if you have a medical emergency. For example, you might go in for emergency care – thinking that your health is in serious danger – and the doctor may say that it wasn’t a medical emergency after all. If it turns out that it was not an emergency, as long as you reasonably thought your health was in serious danger, we will cover your care. </p>
<p><br />However, after the doctor has said that it was <em>not</em> an emergency, the amount of cost-sharing that you pay will depend on whether you get the care from network providers or out-of-network providers. If you get the care from network providers, your share of the costs will usually be lower than if you get the care from out-of-network providers.<br /><br />

<strong><br />What are “urgently needed services”?</strong>
<p>“Urgently needed services” are non-emergency, unforeseen medical illness, injury, or condition that requires immediate medical care. Urgently needed services may be furnished by network providers or by out-of-network providers when network providers are temporarily unavailable or inaccessible. The unforeseen condition could, for example, be an unforeseen flare-up of a known condition that you have.</p>
<strong><br />What if you are in the plan’s service area when you have an urgent need for care?</strong><br />
<p>In most situations, if you are in the plan's service area and you use an out-of-network provider, you will pay a higher share of the costs for your care. </p>
<p>If you need to locate an urgent care facility, you can find an in-network urgent care center near you by using the <em>Provider <em>& Pharmacy</em> <em>Directory</em></em>, going to our website at <a href="AetnaMedicare.com/findprovider">AetnaMedicare.com/findprovider</a>, or getting help from Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).</p>
<strong><br />What if you are <u>outside</u> the plan’s service area when you have an urgent need for care?</strong>
<p>When you are outside the service area and cannot get care from a network provider, our plan will cover urgently needed services that you get from any provider at the lower in-network cost-sharing amount.</p>
<p> <br />Our plan also covers worldwide services outside of the United States under the following circumstances:
<ul>
<li>Emergency care</li>

<li>Urgently needed care</li>

<li>Emergency ambulance transportation from the scene of an emergency to the nearest medical treatment facility</li>
</ul>
Transportation back to the United States from another country is not covered. Pre-scheduled and/or elective procedures are not covered. See the Medical Benefits Chart in Chapter 4 for more information.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br />A clinical research study (also called a “clinical trial”) is a way that doctors and scientists test new types of medical care, like how well a new cancer drug works. They test new medical care procedures or drugs by asking for volunteers to help with the study. This kind of study is one of the final stages of a research process that helps doctors and scientists see if a new approach works and if it is safe.<br /> </p>
<p>Not all clinical research studies are open to members of our plan. Medicare first needs to approve the research study. If you participate in a study that Medicare has <em>not</em> approved, <em>you will be responsible for paying all costs for your participation in the study.<br /><br /></em></p>
<p>Once Medicare approves the study, someone who works on the study will contact you to explain more about the study and see if you meet the requirements set by the scientists who are running the study. You can participate in the study as long as you meet the requirements for the study <em>and</em> you have a full understanding and acceptance of what is involved if you participate in the study.<br /><br /></p>
<p>If you participate in a Medicare-approved study, Original Medicare pays most of the costs for the covered services you receive as part of the study. When you are in a clinical research study, you may stay enrolled in our plan and continue to get the rest of your care (the care that is not related to the study) through our plan.<br /><br /></p>
<p>If you want to participate in a Medicare-approved clinical research study, you do <em>not</em> need to get approval from us or your PCP. The providers that deliver your care as part of the clinical research study do <em>not</em> need to be part of our plan’s network of providers.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Although you do not need to get our plan’s permission to be in a clinical research study, <strong>you do need to tell us before you start participating in a clinical research study.<br /><br /></strong></p>
<p>If you plan on participating in a clinical research study, contact Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) to let them know that you will be participating in a clinical trial and to find out more specific details about what your plan will pay. </p>

<br />Once you join a Medicare-approved clinical research study, you are covered for routine items and services you receive as part of the study, including:<br />
<ul>
<li>Room and board for a hospital stay that Medicare would pay for even if you weren’t in a study.</li>
<li>An operation or other medical procedure if it is part of the research study.</li>
<li>Treatment of side effects and complications of the new care.</li>
</ul>
Original Medicare pays most of the cost of the covered services you receive as part of the study. After Medicare has paid its share of the cost for these services, our plan will also pay for part of the costs. We will pay the difference between the cost-sharing in Original Medicare and your cost-sharing as a member of our plan. This means you will pay the same amount for the services you receive as part of the study as you would if you received these services from our plan. <br /><br />
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Here’s an example of how the cost-sharing works</em>: Let’s say that you have a lab test that costs $100 as part of the research study. Let’s also say that your share of the costs for this test is $20 under Original Medicare, but the test would be $10 under our plan’s benefits. In this case, Original Medicare would pay $80 for the test and we would pay another $10. This means that you would pay $10, which is the same amount you would pay under our plan’s benefits.<br /><br /></div>
<p>In order for us to pay for our share of the costs, you will need to submit a request for payment. With your request, you will need to send us a copy of your Medicare Summary Notices or other documentation that shows what services you received as part of the study and how much you owe. Please see Chapter 7 for more information about submitting requests for payment.<br /> </p>
<p>When you are part of a clinical research study,<strong> neither Medicare nor our plan will pay for any of the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Generally, Medicare will <em>not</em> pay for the new item or service that the study is testing unless Medicare would cover the item or service even if you were <em>not</em> in a study.</li>
<li>Items and services the study gives you or any participant for free.</li>
<li>Items or services provided only to collect data, and not used in your direct health care. For example, Medicare would not pay for monthly CT scans done as part of the study if your medical condition would normally require only one CT scan.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Do you want to know more?</strong><br />You can get more information about joining a clinical research study by visiting the Medicare website to read or download the publication “Medicare and Clinical Research Studies.” (The publication is available at (<a href="https://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/02226-Medicare-and-Clinical-Research-Studies.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/02226-Medicare-and-Clinical-Research-Studies.pdf</a>).

<br />A religious non-medical health care institution is a facility that provides care for a condition that would ordinarily be treated in a hospital or skilled nursing facility. If getting care in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility is against a member’s religious beliefs, we will instead provide coverage for care in a religious non-medical health care institution. You may choose to pursue medical care at any time for any reason. This benefit is provided only for Part A inpatient services (non-medical health care services).

The member always owns certain items, such as prosthetics. In this section, we discuss other types of DME that you must rent.</p>
<br />
<p>In Original Medicare, people who rent certain types of DME own the equipment after paying copayments for the item for 13 months. As a member of Aetna Medicare Premier (PPO), however, you usually will not acquire ownership of rented DME items no matter how many copayments you make for the item while a member of our plan. Under certain limited circumstances we will transfer ownership of the DME item to you. Call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) to find out about the requirements you must meet and the documentation you need to provide.</p>
<br /><strong>What happens to payments you made for durable medical equipment if you switch to Original Medicare?</strong>
<p>If you did not acquire ownership of the DME item while in our plan, you will have to make 13 new consecutive payments after you switch to Original Medicare in order to own the item. Payments you made while in our plan do not count toward these 13 consecutive payments.<br /> </p>
If you made fewer than 13 payments for the DME item under Original Medicare <em>before</em> you joined our plan, your previous payments also do not count toward the 13 consecutive payments. You will have to make 13 new consecutive payments after you return to Original Medicare in order to own the item. There are no exceptions to this case when you return to Original Medicare.<br /><br />

<br />This chapter focuses on your covered services and what you pay for your medical benefits. It includes a Medical Benefits Chart that lists your covered services and shows how much you will pay for each covered service as a member of Aetna Medicare Premier (PPO).

<br />To understand the payment information we give you in this chapter, you need to know about the types of out-of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered services. <ul>
<li>A <strong>“copayment”</strong> is the fixed amount you pay each time you receive certain medical services. You pay a copayment at the time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart in Section 2 tells you more about your copayments.)</li>
<li><strong>“Coinsurance”</strong> is the percentage you pay of the total cost of certain medical services. You pay a coinsurance at the time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart in Section 2 tells you more about your coinsurance.)</li>
</ul>Most people who qualify for Medicaid or for the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) program should never pay deductibles, copayments or coinsurance. Be sure to show your proof of Medicaid or QMB eligibility to your provider, if applicable. If you think that you are being asked to pay improperly, contact Member Services.<br /><br /></p>

<br />Under our plan, there are two different limits on what you have to pay out-of-pocket for covered medical services:<br />
<ul>
<li>Your <strong>in-network maximum out-of-pocket amount</strong> is <strong>$7,550</strong>. This is the most you pay during the calendar year for covered plan services received from network providers. The amounts you pay for copayments and coinsurance for covered services from network providers count toward this in-network maximum out-of-pocket amount. (The amounts you pay for   Part D prescription drugs and services from out-of-network providers do not count toward your in-network maximum out-of-pocket amount. In addition, amounts you pay for some services do not count toward your in-network maximum out-of-pocket amount. These services are marked with an asterisk in the Medical Benefits Chart.) If you have paid <strong>$7,550</strong> for covered services from network providers, you will not have any out-of-pocket costs for the rest of the year when you see our network providers. However, you must continue to pay the Medicare Part B premium (unless your Part B premium is paid for you by Medicaid or another third party).</li>
<li>Your <strong>combined maximum out-of-pocket amount</strong> is <strong>$7,550</strong>. This is the most you pay during the calendar year for covered plan services received from both in-network and out-of-network providers. The amounts you pay for copayments and coinsurance for covered services count toward this combined maximum out-of-pocket amount. (The amounts you pay for    Part D prescription drugs do not count toward your combined maximum out-of-pocket amount. In addition, amounts you pay for some services do not count toward your combined maximum out-of-pocket amount. These services are marked with an asterisk in the Medical Benefits Chart.) If you have paid <strong>$7,550</strong> for covered services, you will have 100% coverage and will not have any out-of-pocket costs for the rest of the year for covered services. However, you must continue to pay the Medicare Part B premium (unless your Part B premium is paid for you by Medicaid or another third party).</li>

<br />As a member of Aetna Medicare Premier (PPO), an important protection for you is that you only have to pay your cost-sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow providers to add additional separate charges, called “balance billing.” This protection (that you never pay more than your cost-sharing amount) applies even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don’t pay certain provider charges.<br /><br />Here is how this protection works. <br />
<ul>
<li>If your cost-sharing is a copayment (a set amount of dollars, for example, $15.00), then you pay only that amount for any covered services from a network provider. You will generally have higher copays when you obtain care from out-of-network providers.</li>
<li>If your cost-sharing is a coinsurance (a percentage of the total charges), then you never pay more than that percentage. However, your cost depends on which type of provider you see:</li>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>If you obtain covered services from a network provider, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the plan’s reimbursement rate (as determined in the contract between the provider and the plan). </li>
<li>If you obtain covered services from an out-of-network provider who participates with Medicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for participating providers. </li>
<li>If you obtain covered services from an out-of-network provider who does not participate with Medicare, then you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for non-participating providers.  </li>
</ul>
<li>If you believe a provider has “balance billed” you, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).</li>

<br />The Medical Benefits Chart on the following pages lists the services Aetna Medicare Premier (PPO) covers and what you pay out-of-pocket for each service. The services listed in the Medical Benefits Chart are covered only when the following coverage requirements are met: <br />
<ul>
<li>Your Medicare covered services must be provided according to the coverage guidelines established by Medicare.</li>
<li>Your services (including medical care, services, supplies, and equipment) <em>must</em> be medically necessary. “Medically necessary” means that the services, supplies, or drugs are needed for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of your medical condition and meet accepted standards of medical practice.</li>

<li>Some of the services listed in the Medical Benefits Chart are covered as in-network services <em>only</em> if your doctor or other network provider gets approval in advance (sometimes called “prior authorization”) from Aetna Medicare Premier (PPO).
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Covered services that need approval in advance to be covered as in-network services are marked in the Medical Benefits Chart. </li>
<li>You never need approval in advance for out-of-network services from out-of-network providers.</li>
<li>While you don’t need approval in advance for out-of-network services, you or your doctor can ask us to make a coverage decision in advance.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>We may also charge you “administrative fees” for missed appointments or for not paying your required cost-sharing at the time of service. Call Member Services if you have questions regarding these administrative fees. (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet.)</li>
</ul>
Other important things to know about our coverage:
<ul>
<li>For benefits where your cost-sharing is a coinsurance percentage, the amount you pay depends on what type of provider you receive the services from:</li>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>If you receive the covered services from a network provider, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the plan’s reimbursement rate (as determined in the contract between the provider and the plan).</li>
<li>If you receive the covered services from an out-of-network provider who participates with Medicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for participating providers.</li>
<li>If you receive the covered services from an out-of-network provider who does not participate with Medicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for non-participating providers. </li>
</ul>

<li>Like all Medicare health plans, we cover everything that Original Medicare covers. For some of these benefits, you pay <em>more</em> in our plan than you would in Original Medicare. For others, you pay<em> less</em>. (If you want to know more about the coverage and costs of Original Medicare, look in your <em>Medicare & You</em> <em>2022</em> Handbook. View it online at <a href="www.medicare.gov">www.medicare.gov</a> or ask for a copy by calling 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1-877-486-2048.)</li>
<li>For all preventive services that are covered at no cost under Original Medicare, we also cover the service at no cost to you. However, if you also are treated or monitored for an existing medical condition during the visit when you receive the preventive service, a copayment will apply for the care received for the existing medical condition.</li>
<li>Sometimes, Medicare adds coverage under Original Medicare for new services during the year. If Medicare adds coverage for any services during 2022, either Medicare or our plan will cover those services. </li>

<p>When you are continuously absent from our plan’s service area for more than six months, we usually must disenroll you from our plan. However, we offer as a supplemental benefit a visitor/traveler program that is available within the United States, which will allow you to remain enrolled in our plan when you are in the visitor/traveler area and outside of our plan’s service area for up to 12 months. This program is available to all Aetna Medicare Premier (PPO) members who are temporarily in the visitor/traveler area and outside our plan’s service area. Under our visitor/traveler program you may receive all plan covered services at in-network cost-sharing when you see a network provider. In most cases, when you receive non-urgent/non-emergency care from an out-of-network provider (a provider who is not an Aetna Medicare provider), your share of the costs for your covered services may be higher, see Chapter 3, Section 2.3 for more information. Please contact the plan for assistance in locating a provider when using the visitor/traveler benefit.<br /><br />If you are in the visitor/traveler area and outside the plan’s service area, you can stay enrolled in our plan for up to 12 months. If you have not returned to the plan’s service area within 12 months, you will be disenrolled from the plan. Please be sure to notify us when you will be out of the plan’s service area for more than six months.</p>

<p><br />This chapter <strong>explains rules for using your coverage for Part D drugs.</strong> The next chapter tells what you pay for Part D drugs (Chapter 6, <em>What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs</em>).</p>
<br />In addition to your coverage for Part D drugs, Aetna Medicare Premier (PPO) also covers some drugs under the plan’s medical benefits. Through its coverage of Medicare Part A benefits, our plan generally covers drugs you are given during covered stays in the hospital or in a skilled nursing facility. Through its coverage of Medicare Part B benefits, our plan covers drugs including certain chemotherapy drugs, certain drug injections you are given during an office visit, and drugs you are given at a dialysis facility. Chapter 4 (<em>Medical Benefits Chart, what is covered and what you pay</em>) tells about the benefits and costs for drugs during a covered hospital or skilled nursing facility stay, as well as your benefits and costs for Part B drugs.<br /><br />Your drugs may be covered by Original Medicare if you are in Medicare hospice. Our plan only covers Medicare Parts A, B, and D services and drugs that are unrelated to your terminal prognosis and related conditions and therefore not covered under the Medicare hospice benefit. For more information, please see Section 9.4 (<em>What if you’re in Medicare-certified hospice</em>). For information on hospice coverage and Part C, see the hospice section of Chapter 4 (<em>Medical Benefits Chart, what is covered and what you pay</em>).<br /><br />The following sections discuss coverage of your drugs under the plan’s Part D benefit rules. Section 9, <em>Part D drug coverage in special situations</em> includes more information on your Part D coverage and Original Medicare.<br /><br />

<p><br />The plan will generally cover your drugs as long as you follow these basic rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have a provider (a doctor, dentist or other prescriber) write your prescription.</li>
<li>Your prescriber must either accept Medicare or file documentation with CMS showing that he or she is qualified to write prescriptions, or your Part D claim will be denied. You should ask your prescribers the next time you call or visit if they meet this condition. If not, please be aware it takes time for your prescriber to submit the necessary paperwork to be processed.</li>
<li>You generally must use a network pharmacy to fill your prescription. (See Section 2, <em>Fill your prescriptions at a network pharmacy  or through the plan’s mail-order service</em>.)</li>
<li>Your drug must be on the plan’s <em>List of Covered Drugs (Formulary)</em> (we call it the “Drug List” for short). (See Section 3, <em>Your drugs need to be on the plan’s “Drug List.”</em>)</li>
<li>Your drug must be used for a medically accepted indication. A “medically accepted indication” is a use of the drug that is either approved by the Food and Drug Administration or supported by certain reference books. (See Section 3 for more information about a medically accepted indication.)</li>

<br />In most cases, your prescriptions are covered <em>only</em> if they are filled at the plan’s network pharmacies. (See Section 2.5 for information about when we would cover prescriptions filled at out-of-network pharmacies.)<br /><br />
<p>A network pharmacy is a pharmacy that has a contract with the plan to provide your covered prescription drugs. The term “covered drugs” means all of the Part D prescription drugs that are covered on the plan’s Drug List.</p>
<br style="font-size: 14.6667px;" />
<p style="font-size: 14.6667px;">Our network includes pharmacies that offer standard cost-sharing and pharmacies that offer preferred cost-sharing. You may go to either type of network pharmacy to receive your covered prescription drugs. Your cost-sharing may be less at pharmacies with preferred cost-sharing.</p>

<strong><br />How do you find a network pharmacy in your area?</strong>
<p>To find a network pharmacy, you can look in your <em>Provider & Pharmacy Directory</em>, visit our website <br />(<a href="AetnaMedicare.com/findpharmacy">AetnaMedicare.com/findpharmacy</a>), or call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).</p>
<br />You may go to any of our network pharmacies. <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"> However, your costs may be even less for your covered drugs if you use a network pharmacy that offers preferred cost-sharing rather than a network pharmacy that offers standard cost-sharing. The </span><em style="font-size: 14.6667px;">Provider & Pharmacy Directory</em><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"> will tell you which of the network pharmacies offer preferred cost-sharing. You can find out more about how your out-of-pocket costs could be different for different drugs by contacting us.<br /></span><br style="font-size: 14.6667px;" /><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"></span> If you switch from one network pharmacy to another, and you need a refill of a drug you have been taking, you can ask either to have a new prescription written by a provider or to have your prescription transferred to your new network pharmacy.<br /><br />
<p><strong>What if the pharmacy you have been using leaves the network?</strong></p>
If the pharmacy you have been using leaves the plan’s network, you will have to find a new pharmacy that is in the network. Or if the pharmacy you have been using stays within the network but is no longer offering preferred cost-sharing, you may want to switch to a different pharmacy. To find another network pharmacy in your area, you can get help from Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) or use the <em>Provider & Pharmacy Directory</em>. You can also find information on our website at <a href="AetnaMedicare.com/findpharmacy">AetnaMedicare.com/findpharmacy</a>.<br /><br />
<p><strong>What if you need a specialized pharmacy?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes prescriptions must be filled at a specialized pharmacy. Specialized pharmacies include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pharmacies that supply drugs for home infusion therapy.</li>
<li>Pharmacies that supply drugs for residents of a long-term care (LTC) facility. Usually, a long-term care facility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy. If you are in an LTC facility, we must ensure that you are able to routinely receive your Part D benefits through our network of LTC pharmacies, which is typically the pharmacy that the LTC facility uses.  If you have any difficulty accessing your Part D benefits in an LTC facility, please contact Member Services.</li>
<li>Pharmacies that serve the Indian Health Service / Tribal / Urban Indian Health Program (not available in Puerto Rico). Except in emergencies, only Native Americans or Alaska Natives have access to these pharmacies in our network.</li>
<li>Pharmacies that dispense drugs that are restricted by the FDA to certain locations or that require special handling, provider coordination, or education on their use. (<em>Note</em>: This scenario should happen rarely.)</li>
</ul>
To locate a specialized pharmacy, look in your <em>Provider & Pharmacy Directory</em> or call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).<br /><br />

<p><br />For certain kinds of drugs, you can use the plan’s network mail-order services. Generally, the drugs provided through mail-order are drugs that you take on a regular basis, for a chronic or long-term medical condition. The drugs available through our plan’s mail-order service are marked as <strong>“mail-order” (MO) drugs</strong> in our Drug List.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Our plan’s mail-order service allows you to order <strong>up to a </strong><strong>100</strong><strong style="font-size: 11pt;">-day supply</strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To get order forms and information about filling your prescriptions by mail contact Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).<br /><br /></p>
<p>Usually a mail-order pharmacy order will get to you in no more than 10 days. In the unlikely event that there is a significant delay with your mail-order prescription drug, our mail-order service will work with you and a network pharmacy to provide you with a temporary supply of your mail-order prescription drug.</p>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><br />New prescriptions the pharmacy receives directly from your doctor’s office.<br /></strong>The pharmacy will automatically fill and deliver new prescriptions it receives from health care providers, without checking with you first, if either:</div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
<ul>
<li>You used mail-order services with this plan in the past, or </li>
<li>You sign up for automatic delivery of all new prescriptions received directly from health care providers. You may request automatic delivery of all new prescriptions now or at any time by calling Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;">If you receive a prescription automatically by mail that you do not want, and you were not contacted to see if you wanted it before it shipped, you may be eligible for a refund.</div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><br />If you used mail-order in the past and do not want the pharmacy to automatically fill and ship each new prescription, please contact us by calling Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).</div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><br />If you have never used our mail-order delivery and/or decide to stop automatic fills of new prescriptions, the pharmacy will contact you each time it gets a new prescription from a health care provider to see if you want the medication filled and shipped immediately. This will give you an opportunity to make sure that the pharmacy is delivering the correct drug (including strength, amount, and form) and, if necessary, allow you to cancel or delay the order before you are billed and it is shipped.

<br />When you get a long-term supply of drugs, your cost-sharing may be lower. The plan offers two ways  to get a long-term supply (also called an “extended supply”) of “maintenance” drugs on our plan’s Drug List. (Maintenance drugs are drugs that you take on a regular basis, for a chronic or long-term medical condition.) You may order this supply through mail-order (see Section 2.3) or you may go to a retail pharmacy. <br />
<ol>
<li><strong>Some retail pharmacies</strong> in our network allow you to get a long-term supply of maintenance drugs. Your <em>Provider & Pharmacy Directory</em> tells you which pharmacies in our network can give you a long-term supply of maintenance drugs. You can also call Member Services for more information (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).</li>
<li>For certain kinds of drugs, you can use the plan’s network <strong>mail-order services.</strong> The drugs available through our plan’s mail-order service are marked as <strong>“mail-order” (MO) drugs</strong> in our Drug List. Our plan’s mail-order service allows you to order up to a 100-day supply. See Section 2.3 for more information about using our mail-order services.</li>

<strong><br />Your prescription may be covered in certain situations</strong><br />Generally, we cover drugs filled at an out-of-network pharmacy <em>only</em> when you are not able to use a network pharmacy. To help you, we have network pharmacies outside of our service area where you can get your prescriptions filled as a member of our plan. If you cannot use a network pharmacy, here are the circumstances when we would cover prescriptions filled at an out-of-network pharmacy:<br />
<ul>
<li>If you are unable to obtain a covered prescription drug in a timely manner within our service area because there are no network pharmacies within a reasonable driving distance that provides 24-hour service.</li>
<li>If you are trying to fill a prescription drug that is not regularly stocked at an accessible network retail  or mail order  pharmacy (these prescription drugs include orphan drugs or other specialty pharmaceuticals).</li>
<li>If you are traveling outside your service area (within the United States) and run out of your medication, if you lose your medication, or if you become ill and cannot access a network pharmacy.</li>
<li>If you receive a Part D prescription drug, dispensed by an out-of-network institutional-based pharmacy, while you are in the emergency department, provider-based clinic, outpatient surgery or other outpatient setting.</li>
<li>If you have  received your prescription during a state or federal disaster declaration or other public health emergency declaration in which you are evacuated or otherwise displaced from your service area or place of residence.</li>
</ul>
If you do need to go to an out-of-network pharmacy for any of the reasons listed above, the plan will cover up to a 10-day supply of drugs.<br /><br />In these situations, <strong>please check first with Member Services</strong> to see if there is a network pharmacy nearby. (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet.) You may be required to pay the difference between what you pay for the drug at the out-of-network pharmacy and the cost that we would cover at an in-network pharmacy.<br /><strong><br />How do you ask for reimbursement from the plan?<br /></strong>If you must use an out-of-network pharmacy, you will generally have to pay the full cost (rather than your normal share of the cost) at the time you fill your prescription. You can ask us to reimburse you for our share of the cost. (Chapter 7, Section 2.1 explains how to ask the plan to pay you back.)<br /><br />

<p><br />The plan has a <em>“List of Covered Drugs (Formulary).”</em> In this <em>Evidence of Coverage</em>, <strong>we call it the “Drug List” for short</strong>. </p>
<p><br />The drugs on this list are selected by the plan with the help of a team of doctors and pharmacists. The list must meet requirements set by Medicare. Medicare has approved the plan’s Drug List.</p>
<br />The drugs on the Drug List are only those covered under Medicare Part D (earlier in this chapter, Section 1.1 explains about Part D drugs). <br />
<p><br />We will generally cover a drug on the plan’s Drug List as long as you follow the other coverage rules explained in this chapter and the use of the drug is a medically accepted indication. A “medically accepted indication” is a use of the drug that is <em>either</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Approved by the Food and Drug Administration. (That is, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the drug for the diagnosis or condition for which it is being prescribed.)</li>
<li>-- <em>or</em> -- Supported by certain references, such as the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information and the DRUGDEX Information System.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Drug List includes both brand name and generic drugs</strong></p>
<p>A generic drug is a prescription drug that has the same active ingredients as the brand name drug. Generally, it works just as well as the brand name drug and usually costs less. There are generic drug substitutes available for many brand name drugs.<br /><br /></p>
<strong>What is<em> not</em> on the Drug List?<br /></strong>
<p>The plan does not cover all prescription drugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>In some cases, the law does not allow any Medicare plan to cover certain types of drugs (for more about this, see Section 7.1 in this chapter).</li>
<li>In other cases, we have decided not to include a particular drug on our Drug List. </li>

<br />Every drug on the plan’s Drug List is in one of 5 cost-sharing tiers. In general, the higher the cost-sharing tier, the higher your cost for the drug:<br />
<ul>
<li>Tier 1: Preferred Generic - Our lowest cost-share tier includes many lower cost generic drugs</li>
<li>Tier 2: Generic - Includes higher cost generic drugs</li>
<li>Tier 3: Preferred Brand - Includes many common cost-effective brand name drugs and some generic drugs that cost as much as brand name drugs</li>
<li>Tier 4: Non-Preferred Drug - Includes many more higher cost brand name and generic drugs for which a cheaper alternative is typically available</li>
<li>Tier 5: Specialty - Our highest cost-share tier includes both high cost brand and generic drugs that meet Medicare’s definition of a specialty drug</li>
</ul>
To find out which cost-sharing tier your drug is in, look it up in the plan’s Drug List. <br /><br />The amount you pay for drugs in each cost-sharing tier is shown in Chapter 6 (<em>What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs</em>).<br />

</table>
<br />For certain prescription drugs, special rules restrict how and when the plan covers them. A team of doctors and pharmacists developed these rules to help our members use drugs in the most effective ways. These special rules also help control overall drug costs, which keeps your drug coverage more affordable.<br /><br />In general, our rules encourage you to get a drug that works for your medical condition and is safe and effective. Whenever a safe, lower-cost drug will work just as well medically as a higher-cost drug, the plan’s rules are designed to encourage you and your provider to use that lower-cost option. We also need to comply with Medicare’s rules and regulations for drug coverage and cost-sharing.<br /><br /><strong>If there is a restriction for your drug, it usually means that you or your provider will have to take extra steps in order for us to cover the drug.</strong> If you want us to waive the restriction for you, you will need to use the coverage decision process and ask us to make an exception. We may or may not agree to waive the restriction for you. (See Chapter 9, Section 6.2 for information about asking for exceptions.)<br /><br />Please note that sometimes a drug may appear more than once in our Drug List. This is because different restrictions or cost-sharing may apply based on factors such as the strength, amount, or form of the drug prescribed by your health care provider (for instance, 10 mg versus 100 mg; one per day versus two per day; tablet versus liquid).<br /><br />

<td class="none">What kinds of restrictions?</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br />Our plan uses different types of restrictions to help our members use drugs in the most effective ways. The sections below tell you more about the types of restrictions we use for certain drugs.<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Restricting brand name drugs when a generic version is available<br /></strong>Generally, a “generic” drug works the same as a brand name drug and usually costs less. <strong>In most cases, when a generic version of a brand name drug is available, our network pharmacies will provide you the generic version.</strong> We usually will not cover the brand name drug when a generic version is available. However, if your provider has told us the medical reason that the generic drug will not work for you or the medical reason that neither the generic drug nor other covered drugs that treat the same condition will work for you, then we will cover the brand name drug. (Your share of the cost may be greater for the brand name drug than for the generic drug.)</p>
<p><strong><br />Getting plan approval in advance</strong></p>
<p>For certain drugs, you or your provider need to get approval from the plan before we will agree to cover the drug for you. This is called <strong>“prior authorization.”</strong> Sometimes the requirement for getting approval in advance helps guide appropriate use of certain drugs. If you do not get this approval, your drug might not be covered by the plan.</p>
<div><strong><br />Trying a different drug first</strong></div>
<p>This requirement encourages you to try less costly but usually just as effective drugs before the plan covers another drug. For example, if Drug A and Drug B treat the same medical condition, the plan may require you to try Drug A first. If Drug A does not work for you, the plan will then cover Drug B. This requirement to try a different drug first is called <strong>“step therapy.”</strong></p>
<div><strong><br />Quantity limits </strong></div>
<p>For certain drugs, we limit the amount of the drug that you can have by limiting how much of a drug you can get each time you fill your prescription. For example, if it is normally considered safe to take only one pill per day for a certain drug, we may limit coverage for your prescription to no more than one pill per day.<br /><br /></p>

<br />We hope that your drug coverage will work well for you. But it’s possible that there could be a prescription drug you are currently taking, or one that you and your provider think you should be taking, that is not on our formulary or is on our formulary with restrictions.<br />For example:<br />
<ul>
<li>The drug might not be covered at all. Or maybe a generic version of the drug is covered but the brand name version you want to take is not covered.</li>
<li>The drug is covered, but there are extra rules or restrictions on coverage for that drug. As explained in Section 4, some of the drugs covered by the plan have extra rules to restrict their use. For example, you might be required to try a different drug first, to see if it will work, before the drug you want to take will be covered for you. Or there might be limits on what amount of the drug (number of pills, etc.) is covered during a particular time period. In some cases, you may want us to waive the restriction for you.</li>

<li>The drug is covered, but it is in a cost-sharing tier that makes your cost-sharing more expensive than you think it should be. The plan puts each covered drug into one of 5 different cost-sharing tiers. How much you pay for your prescription depends in part on which cost-sharing tier your drug is in.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are things you can do if your drug is not covered in the way that you’d like it to be covered. Your options depend on what type of problem you have:</p>

<ul>
<li>If your drug is not on the Drug List or if your drug is restricted, go to Section 5.2 to learn what you can do.</li>

<li>If your drug is in a cost-sharing tier that makes your cost more expensive than you think it should be, go to Section 5.3 to learn what you can do.</li>

<p><br />If your drug is not on the Drug List or is restricted, here are things you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may be able to get a temporary supply of the drug (only members in certain situations can get a temporary supply). This will give you and your provider time to change to another drug or to file a request to have the drug covered.</li>
<li>You can change to another drug.</li>
<li>You can request an exception and ask the plan to cover the drug or remove restrictions from the drug.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You may be able to get a temporary supply</strong></p>
<p>Under certain circumstances, the plan must offer a temporary supply of a drug to you when your drug is not on the Drug List or when it is restricted in some way. Doing this gives you time to talk with your provider about the change in coverage and figure out what to do.</p>
<p><br />To be eligible for a temporary supply, you must meet the two requirements below:<br /><br /><strong>1.</strong>  <strong>The change to your drug coverage must be one of the following types of changes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The drug you have been taking is<strong> no longer on the plan’s Drug List.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>-- or -- the drug you have been taking is<strong> now restricted in some way</strong> (Section 4 in this chapter tells about restrictions). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<strong>2. </strong> <strong style="font-size: 11pt;">You must be in one of the situations described below:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>For those members who are new or who were in the plan last year:<br /></strong>We will cover a temporary supply of your drug <strong style="font-size: 11pt;">during the first 90 days of your membership in the plan if you were new and during the first 90 days of the calendar year if you were in the plan last year.</strong> This temporary supply will be for a maximum of a 30-day supply. If your prescription is written for fewer days, we will allow multiple fills to provide up to a maximum of a 30-day supply of medication. The prescription must be filled at a network pharmacy. (Please note that the long-term care pharmacy may provide the drug in smaller amounts at a time to prevent waste.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For those members who have been in the plan for more than 90 days and reside in a long-term care (LTC) facility and need a supply right away:<br /></strong>We will cover one 31-day supply of a particular drug, or less if your prescription is written for fewer days. This is in addition to the above temporary supply situation.</p>
</li>
<li>If you experience a change in your setting of care (such as being discharged or admitted to a long-term care facility), your physician or pharmacy can request a temporary supply of the drug. This temporary supply (up to 30 days) will allow you time to talk with your doctor about the change in coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>To ask for a temporary supply, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).</p>
<p><br />During the time when you are getting a temporary supply of a drug, you should talk with your provider to decide what to do when your temporary supply runs out. You can either switch to a different drug covered by the plan or ask the plan to make an exception for you and cover your current drug. The sections below tell you more about these options.</p>
<p><strong><br />You can change to another drug </strong></p>
<p>Start by talking with your provider. Perhaps there is a different drug covered by the plan that might work just as well for you. You can call Member Services to ask for a list of covered drugs that treat the same medical condition. This list can help your provider find a covered drug that might work for you. (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet.)</p>
<p><strong><br />You can ask for an exception</strong></p>
<p>You and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception for you and cover the drug in the way you would like it to be covered. If your provider says that you have medical reasons that justify asking us for an exception, your provider can help you request an exception to the rule. For example, you can ask the plan to cover a drug even though it is not on the plan’s Drug List. Or you can ask the plan to make an exception and cover the drug without restrictions.<br /><br /></p>
<p>If you are a current member and a drug you are taking will be removed from the formulary or restricted in some way for next year, we will allow you to request a formulary exception in advance for next year. We will tell you about any change in the coverage for your drug for next year. You can ask for an exception before next year and we will give you an answer within 72 hours after we receive your request (or your prescriber’s supporting statement). If we approve your request, we will authorize the coverage before the change takes effect.</p>
<p><br />If you and your provider want to ask for an exception, Chapter 9, Section 6.4 tells what to do. It explains the procedures and deadlines that have been set by Medicare to make sure your request is handled promptly and fairly.</p>

<p><br />Most of the changes in drug coverage happen at the beginning of each year (January 1). However, during the year, the plan might make changes to the Drug List. For example, the plan might:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add or remove drugs from the Drug List.</strong> New drugs become available, including new generic drugs. Perhaps the government has given approval to a new use for an existing drug. Sometimes, a drug gets recalled and we decide not to cover it. Or we might remove a drug from the list because it has been found to be ineffective. </li>

<li><strong>Move a drug to a higher or lower cost-sharing tier.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Add or remove a restriction on coverage for a drug</strong> (for more information about restrictions to coverage, see Section 4 in this chapter).</li>
<li><strong>Replace a brand name drug with a generic drug. </strong></li>
</ul>
We must follow Medicare requirements before we change the plan’s Drug List.<br /><br />

<strong><br />Information on changes to drug coverage</strong>
<p>When changes to the Drug List occur during the year, we post information on our website about those changes. We will update our online Drug List on a regularly scheduled basis to include any changes that have occurred after the last update. Below we point out the times that you would get direct notice if changes are made to a drug that you are then taking. You can also call Member Services for more information (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong>Do changes to your drug coverage affect you right away?</strong></p>
<p>Changes that can affect you this year: In the below cases, you will be affected by the coverage changes during the current year: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A new generic drug replaces a brand name drug on the Drug List (or we change the cost-sharing tier or add new restrictions to the brand name drug or both)</strong>
<ul>
<li>We may immediately remove a brand name drug on our Drug List if we are replacing it with a newly approved generic version of the same drug that will appear on the same or lower cost-sharing tier and with the same or fewer restrictions. Also, when adding the new generic drug, we may decide to keep the brand name drug on our Drug List, but immediately move it to a higher cost-sharing tier or add new restrictions or both.</li>
<li>We may not tell you in advance before we make that change — even if you are currently taking the brand name drug.</li>
<li>You or your prescriber can ask us to make an exception and continue to cover the brand name drug for you. For information on how to ask for an exception, see Chapter 9 (<em>What to do if you have a problem or complaint</em> (<em>coverage decisions, appeals, complaints</em>)).</li>
<li>If you are taking the brand name drug at the time we make the change, we will provide you with information about the specific change(s) we made. This will also include information on the steps you may take to request an exception to cover the brand name drug. You may not get this notice before we make the change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Unsafe drugs and other drugs on the Drug List that are withdrawn from the market</strong>
<ul>
<li>Once in a while, a drug may be suddenly withdrawn because it has been found to be unsafe or removed from the market for another reason. If this happens, we will immediately remove the drug from the Drug List. If you are taking that drug, we will let you know of this change right away. </li>
<li>Your prescriber will also know about this change, and can work with you to find another drug for your condition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Other changes to drugs on the Drug List</strong> 
<ul>
<li>We may make other changes once the year has started that affect drugs you are taking. For instance, we might add a generic drug that is not new to the market to replace a brand name drug or change the cost-sharing tier or add new restrictions to the brand name drug or both. We also might make changes based on FDA boxed warnings or new clinical guidelines recognized by Medicare. We must give you at least 30 days’ advance notice of the change or give you notice of the change and a 30-day refill of the drug you are taking at a network pharmacy.</li>
<li>After you receive notice of the change, you should be working with your prescriber to switch to a different drug that we cover.</li>
<li>Or you or your prescriber can ask us to make an exception and continue to cover the drug for you. For information on how to ask for an exception, see Chapter 9 (<em>What to do if you have a problem or complaint</em> (<em>coverage decisions, appeals, complaints)</em>).</li>

<p><strong>Changes to drugs on the Drug List that will not affect people currently taking the drug:</strong> For changes to the Drug List that are not described above, if you are currently taking the drug the following types of changes will not affect you until January 1 of the next year if you stay in the plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we move your drug into a higher cost-sharing tier</li>

<li>If we put a new restriction on your use of the drug</li>
<li>If we remove your drug from the Drug List</li>
</ul>
If any of these changes happen for a drug you are taking (but not because of a market withdrawal, a generic drug replacing a brand name drug, or other change noted in the sections above), then the change won’t affect your use or what you pay as your share of the cost until January 1 of the next year. Until that date, you probably won’t see any increase in your payments or any added restriction to your use of the drug. You will not get direct notice this year about changes that do not affect you. However, on January 1 of the next year, the changes will affect you, and it is important to check the Drug List in the new benefit year for any changes to drugs.<br /><br />

<br />This section tells you what kinds of prescription drugs are “excluded.” This means Medicare does not pay for these drugs.<br /><br />If you get drugs that are excluded, you must pay for them yourself. We won’t pay for the drugs that are listed in this section. The only exception: If the requested drug is found upon appeal to be a drug that is not excluded under Part D and we should have paid for or covered it because of your specific situation. (For information about appealing a decision we have made to not cover a drug, go to Chapter 9, Section 6.5 in this booklet.) <br /><br />Here are three general rules about drugs that Medicare drug plans will not cover under Part D:<br />
<ul>
<li>Our plan’s Part D drug coverage cannot cover a drug that would be covered under Medicare Part A or Part B.</li>
<li>Our plan cannot cover a drug purchased outside the United States and its territories.</li>
<li>Our plan usually cannot cover off-label use. “Off-label use” is any use of the drug other than those indicated on a drug’s label as approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</li>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Generally, coverage for “off-label use” is allowed only when the use is supported by certain references, such as the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information and the DRUGDEX Information System. If the use is not supported by any of these references, then our plan cannot cover its “off-label use.”</li>
</ul>
</ul>
Also, by law, these categories of drugs are not covered by Medicare drug plans: 
<ul>
<li>Non-prescription drugs (also called over-the-counter drugs)</li>
<li>Drugs when used to promote fertility</li>
<li>Drugs when used for the relief of cough or cold symptoms</li>
<li>Drugs when used for cosmetic purposes or to promote hair growth</li>
<li>Prescription vitamins and mineral products, except prenatal vitamins and fluoride preparations</li>
<li>Drugs when used for the treatment of sexual or erectile dysfunction</li>
<li>Drugs when used for treatment of anorexia, weight loss, or weight gain</li>
<li>Outpatient drugs for which the manufacturer seeks to require that associated tests or monitoring services be purchased exclusively from the manufacturer as a condition of sale</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you receive “Extra Help” paying for your drugs,</strong> your state Medicaid program may cover some prescription drugs not normally covered in a Medicare drug plan. Please contact your state Medicaid program to determine what drug coverage may be available to you. (You can find phone numbers and contact information for Medicaid in <strong>Addendum A</strong> at the back of this booklet.)</p>

See the previous parts of this section that tell about the rules for getting drug coverage. Chapter 6 (<em>What you pay for your Part D prescription drugs</em>) gives more information about drug coverage and what you pay.<br /><br /><strong>Please Note:</strong> When you enter, live in, or leave a skilled nursing facility, you are entitled to a Special Enrollment Period.

<p><br />Usually, a long-term care (LTC) facility (such as a nursing home) has its own pharmacy, or a pharmacy that supplies drugs for all of its residents. If you are a resident of a long-term care facility, you may get your prescription drugs through the facility’s pharmacy as long as it is part of our network.</p>
<p><br />Check your <em>Provider & Pharmacy Directory</em> to find out if your long-term care facility’s pharmacy is part of our network. If it isn’t, or if you need more information, please contact Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). </p>
<strong><br />What if you’re a resident in a long-term care (LTC) facility and become a new member of the plan?<br /></strong>If you need a drug that is not on our Drug List or is restricted in some way, the plan will cover a <strong>temporary supply</strong> of your drug during the first 90 days of your membership. The total supply will be for a maximum of a 31-day supply, or less if your prescription is written for fewer days. (Please note that the long-term care pharmacy may provide the drug in smaller amounts at a time to prevent waste.) If you have been a member of the plan for more than 90 days and need a drug that is not on our Drug List or if the plan has any restriction on the drug’s coverage, we will cover one 31-day supply, or less if your prescription is written for fewer days.<br /><br />During the time when you are getting a temporary supply of a drug, you should talk with your provider to decide what to do when your temporary supply runs out. Perhaps there is a different drug covered by the plan that might work just as well for you. Or you and your provider can ask the plan to make an exception for you and cover the drug in the way you would like it to be covered. If you and your provider want to ask for an exception, Chapter 9, Section 6.4 tells what to do.<br /><br />

<br />Do you currently have other prescription drug coverage through your (or your spouse’s) employer or retiree group? If so, please contact <strong>that group’s benefits administrator</strong>. He or she can help you determine how your current prescription drug coverage will work with our plan.<br /><br />In general, if you are currently employed, the prescription drug coverage you get from us will be <em>secondary</em> to your employer or retiree group coverage. That means your group coverage would pay first. <br /><br />
<p><strong>Special note about 'creditable coverage':</strong> </p>
<p>Each year your employer or retiree group should send you a notice that tells if your prescription drug coverage for the next calendar year is “creditable” and the choices you have for drug coverage. </p>
<p>If the coverage from the group plan is “<strong>creditable</strong>,” it means that the plan has drug coverage that is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage.</p>
<p><strong><br />Keep these notices about creditable coverage,</strong> because you may need them later. If you enroll in a Medicare plan that includes Part D drug coverage, you may need these notices to show that you have maintained creditable coverage. If you didn’t get a notice about creditable coverage from your employer or retiree group plan, you can get a copy from the employer or retiree group’s benefits administrator or the employer or union.</p>

<p><br />Drugs are never covered by both hospice and our plan at the same time. If you are enrolled in Medicare hospice and require an anti-nausea, laxative, pain medication or antianxiety drug that is not covered by your hospice because it is unrelated to your terminal illness and related conditions, our plan must receive notification from either the prescriber or your hospice provider that the drug is unrelated before our plan can cover the drug. To prevent delays in receiving any unrelated drugs that should be covered by our plan, you can ask your hospice provider or prescriber to make sure we have the notification that the drug is unrelated before you ask a pharmacy to fill your prescription.<br /><br /></p>
<p>In the event you either revoke your hospice election or are discharged from hospice our plan should cover all your drugs. To prevent any delays at a pharmacy when your Medicare hospice benefit ends, you should bring documentation to the pharmacy to verify your revocation or discharge.

We do a review each time you fill a prescription. We also review our records on a regular basis. During these reviews, we look for potential problems such as:
<ul>
<li>Possible medication errors</li>
<li>Drugs that may not be necessary because you are taking another drug to treat the same medical condition</li>
<li>Drugs that may not be safe or appropriate because of your age or gender</li>

<li>Prescriptions written for drugs that have ingredients you are allergic to</li>
<li>Possible errors in the amount (dosage) of a drug you are taking</li>

<br />We have a program that can help make sure our members safely use their prescription opioid medications, and other medications that are frequently abused. This program is called a Drug Management Program (DMP). If you use opioid medications that you get from several doctors or pharmacies, or if you have had a recent overdose, we may talk to your doctors to make sure your use of opioid medications is appropriate and medically necessary. Working with your doctors, if we decide your use of prescription opioid or benzodiazepine medications is not safe, we may limit how you can get those medications. The limitations may be:<br />
<ul>
<li>Requiring you to get all your prescriptions for opioid or benzodiazepine medications from a certain pharmacy(ies)</li>
<li>Requiring you to get all your prescriptions for opioid or benzodiazepine medications from a certain doctor(s)</li>
<li>Limiting the amount of opioid or benzodiazepine medications we will cover for you</li>
</ul>
<p>If we think that one or more of these limitations should apply to you, we will send you a letter in advance. The letter will have information explaining the terms of limitations we think should apply to you. You will also have an opportunity to tell us which doctors or pharmacies you prefer to use, and about any other information you think is important for us to know. After you’ve had the opportunity to respond, if we decide to limit your coverage for these medications, we will send you another letter confirming the limitation. If you think we made a mistake or you disagree with our determination that you are at-risk for prescription drug misuse or with the limitation, you and your prescriber have the right to ask us for an appeal. If you choose to appeal, we will review your case and give you a decision. If we continue to deny any part of your request related to the limitations that apply to your access to medications, we will automatically send your case to an independent reviewer outside of our plan. See Chapter 9 for information about how to ask for an appeal.</p>
<br />The DMP may not apply to you if you have certain medical conditions, such as cancer or sickle-cell disease, you are receiving hospice, palliative, or end-of-life care, or live in a long-term care facility.<br /><br />

<p><br />We have a program that can help our members with complex health needs.<br /><br /></p>
<p>This program is voluntary and free to members. A team of pharmacists and doctors developed the programs for us. This program can help make sure that our members get the most benefit from the drugs they take. One program is called a Medication Therapy Management (MTM) program.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Some members who take medications for different medical conditions and have high drug costs, or are in a DMP to help members use their opioids safely may be able to get services through an MTM program. A pharmacist or other health professional will give you a comprehensive review of all your medications. You can talk about how best to take your medications, your costs, and any problems or questions you have about your prescription and over-the-counter medications. You’ll get a written summary of this discussion. The summary has a medication action plan that recommends what you can do to make the best use of your medications, with space for you to take notes or write down any follow-up questions. You’ll also get a personal medication list that will include all the medications you’re taking and why you take them. In addition, members in the MTM program will receive information on the safe disposal of prescription medications that are controlled substances.</p>
<br />
<p>It’s a good idea to have your medication review before your yearly “Wellness” visit, so you can talk to your doctor about your action plan and medication list. Bring your action plan and medication list with you to your visit or anytime you talk with your doctors, pharmacists, and other health care providers. Also, keep your medication list with you (for example, with your ID) in case you go to the hospital or emergency room.<br /><br /></p>
<p>If we have a program that fits your needs, we will automatically enroll you in the program and send you information. If you decide not to participate, please notify us and we will withdraw you from the program.

<p><br />This chapter focuses on what you pay for your Part D prescription drugs. To keep things simple, we use “drug” in this chapter to mean a Part D prescription drug. As explained in Chapter 5, not all drugs are Part D drugs – some drugs are covered under Medicare Part A or Part B and other drugs are excluded from Medicare coverage by law.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>To understand the payment information we give you in this chapter, you need to know the basics of what drugs are covered, where to fill your prescriptions, and what rules to follow when you get your covered drugs. Here are materials that explain these basics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The plan’s <em>List of Covered Drugs (Formulary).</em></strong> To keep things simple, we call this the “Drug List.”</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>This Drug List tells which drugs are covered for you.</li>

<li>It also tells which of the 5 “cost-sharing tiers” the drug is in and whether there are any restrictions on your coverage for the drug.</li>

<li>If you need a copy of the Drug List, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). You can also find the Drug List on our website at <a href="AetnaMedicare.com/formulary">AetnaMedicare.com/formulary</a>. The Drug List on the website is always the most current.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Chapter 5 of this booklet.</strong> Chapter 5 gives the details about your prescription drug coverage, including rules you need to follow when you get your covered drugs. Chapter 5 also tells which types of prescription drugs are not covered by our plan.</li>
<li><strong>The plan’s <em>Provider & Pharmacy Directory.</em></strong> In most situations you must use a network pharmacy to get your covered drugs (see Chapter 5 for the details). The <em>Provider & Pharmacy Directory</em> has a list of pharmacies in the plan’s network. It also tells you which pharmacies in our network can give you a long-term supply of a drug (such as filling a prescription for a three-month’s supply).</li>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>“deductible”</strong> is the amount you must pay for drugs before our plan begins to pay its share.</li>

<li>We keep track of how much you have paid. This is called your “<strong>out-of-pocket</strong>” cost.</li>
<li>We keep track of your “<strong>total drug costs</strong>.” This is the amount you pay out-of-pocket or others pay on your behalf plus the amount paid by the plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our plan will prepare a written summary called the <em>Part D Explanation of Benefits</em> (it is sometimes called the “Part D EOB”) when you have had one or more prescriptions filled through the plan during the previous month. The Part D EOB provides more information about the drugs you take, such as increases in price and other drugs with lower cost-sharing that may be available. You should consult with your prescriber about these lower cost options.  It includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information for that month.</strong> This report gives the payment details about the prescriptions you have filled during the previous month. It shows the total drug costs, what the plan paid, and what you and others on your behalf paid.</li>
<li><strong>Totals for the year since January 1.</strong> This is called “year-to-date” information. It shows you the total drug costs and total payments for your drugs since the year began.</li>
<li><strong>Drug price information.</strong> This information will display the total drug price, and any percentage change from first fill for each prescription claim of the same quantity.</li>
<li><strong>Available lower cost alternative prescriptions</strong>. This will include information about other drugs with lower cost-sharing for each prescription claim that may be available.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />To keep track of your drug costs and the payments you make for drugs, we use records we get from pharmacies. Here is how you can help us keep your information correct and up to date:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Show your membership card when you get a prescription filled.</strong> To make sure we know about the prescriptions you are filling and what you are paying, show your plan membership card every time you get a prescription filled.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Make sure we have the information we need</strong>. There are times you may pay for prescription drugs when we will not automatically get the information we need to keep track of your out-of-pocket costs. To help us keep track of your out-of-pocket costs, you may give us copies of receipts for drugs that you have purchased. (If you are billed for a covered drug, you can ask our plan to pay our share of the cost. For instructions on how to do this, go to Chapter 7, Section 2 of this booklet.) Here are some types of situations when you may want to give us copies of your drug receipts to be sure we have a complete record of what you have spent for your drugs:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>When you purchase a covered drug at a network pharmacy at a special price or using a discount card that is not part of our plan’s benefit.</li>
<li>When you made a copayment for drugs that are provided under a drug manufacturer patient assistance program.</li>
<li>Any time you have purchased covered drugs at out-of-network pharmacies or other times you have paid the full price for a covered drug under special circumstances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Send us information about the payments others have made for you</strong>. Payments made by certain other individuals and organizations also count toward your out-of-pocket costs and help qualify you for catastrophic coverage. For example, payments made by a State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program, an AIDS drug assistance program (ADAP), the Indian Health Service, and most charities count toward your out-of-pocket costs. You should keep a record of these payments and send them to us so we can track your costs.</li>
<li><strong>Check the written report we send you</strong>. When you receive the <em>Part D Explanation of Benefits</em> (a Part D EOB) in the mail, please look it over to be sure the information is complete and correct. If you think something is missing from the report, or you have any questions, please call us at Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). Be sure to keep these reports. They are an important record of your drug expenses.</li>

<p><br />The Deductible Stage is the first payment stage for your drug coverage. You will pay a yearly deductible of $150 on  Tier 4 and Tier 5 drugs. <strong>You must pay the full cost of your  Tier 4 and Tier 5 drugs</strong> until you reach the plan’s deductible amount. For all other drugs you will not have to pay any deductible and will start receiving coverage immediately.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your <strong>“full cost”</strong> is usually lower than the normal full price of the drug, since our plan has negotiated lower costs for most drugs.</li>

<p><br />During the Initial Coverage Stage, the plan pays its share of the cost of your covered prescription drugs, and you pay your share (your copayment or coinsurance amount). Your share of the cost will vary depending on the drug and where you fill your prescription.</p>
<div> </div>
<strong>The plan has 5 cost-sharing tiers</strong>
<p>Every drug on the plan’s Drug List is in one of 5 cost-sharing tiers. In general, the higher the cost-sharing tier number, the higher your cost for the drug:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1: Preferred Generic - has the lowest copayment.</li>
<li>Tier 2: Generic - has a copayment that is higher than Tier 1.</li>
<li>Tier 3: Preferred Brand - includes preferred brand drugs and some generic drugs and has a copayment that is higher than Tiers 1 and 2.</li>
<li>Tier 4: Non-Preferred Drug - includes <span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">non-preferred brand drugs and </span>some non-preferred generic drugs and has a copayment that is probably higher than Tiers 1, 2 and 3.</li>
<li>Tier 5: Specialty - includes high cost brand drugs and generic drugs and has a coinsurance that probably results in a higher out-of-pocket cost than drugs on other tiers.</li>
</ul>
To find out which cost-sharing tier your drug is in, look it up in the plan’s Drug List.
<div> </div>

<p><strong>Your pharmacy choices</strong></p>
<div>How much you pay for a drug depends on whether you get the drug from:</div>
<ul>
<li>A network retail pharmacy that offers standard cost-sharing</li>
<li>A network retail pharmacy that offers preferred cost-sharing</li>

<li>A pharmacy that is not in the plan’s network</li>
<li>The plan’s mail-order pharmacy</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about these pharmacy choices and filling your prescriptions, see Chapter 5 in this booklet and the plan’s <em>Provider & Pharmacy Directory.</em></p>

<div> </div>
<p>Generally, we will cover your prescriptions <em>only</em> if they are filled at one of our network pharmacies. Some of our network pharmacies also offer preferred cost-sharing. You may go to either network pharmacies that offer preferred cost-sharing or other network pharmacies that offer standard cost-sharing to receive your covered prescription drugs. Your costs may be less at pharmacies that offer preferred cost-sharing.</p>

During the Initial Coverage Stage, your share of the cost of a covered drug will be either a copayment or coinsurance.
<ul>
<li><strong>“Copayment”</strong> means that you pay a fixed amount each time you fill a prescription.</li>
<li><strong>“Coinsurance”</strong> means that you pay a percent of the total cost of the drug each time you fill a prescription.</li>
</ul>
<p>As shown in the table below, the amount of the copayment or coinsurance depends on which cost-sharing tier your drug is in. Please note:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your covered drug costs less than the copayment amount listed in the chart, you will pay that lower price for the drug. You pay <em>either</em> the full price of the drug <em>or</em> the copayment amount, <em>whichever is lower</em>.</li>
<li>We cover prescriptions filled at out-of-network pharmacies in only limited situations. Please see Chapter 5, Section 2.5 for information about when we will cover a prescription filled at an out-of-network pharmacy.</li>

<p><br />Typically, the amount you pay for a prescription drug covers you a full month’s supply of a covered drug. However, your doctor can prescribe less than a month’s supply of drugs. There may be times when you want to ask your doctor about prescribing less than a month’s supply of a drug (for example, when you are trying a medication for the first time that is known to have serious side effects). If your doctor prescribes less than a full month’s supply, you will not have to pay for the full month’s supply for certain drugs.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>The amount you pay when you get less than a full month’s supply will depend on whether you are responsible for paying coinsurance (a percentage of the total cost) or a copayment (a flat dollar amount).</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are responsible for coinsurance, you pay a <em>percentage</em> of the total cost of the drug. You pay the same percentage regardless of whether the prescription is for a full month’s supply or for fewer days. However, because the entire drug cost will be lower if you get less than a full month’s supply, the <em>amount</em> you pay will be less.</li>
<li>
<p>If you are responsible for a copayment for the drug, your copay will be based on the number of days of the drug that you receive. We will calculate the amount you pay per day for your drug (the “daily cost-sharing rate”) and multiply it by the number of days of the drug you receive.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Here’s an example: Let’s say the copay for your drug for a full month’s supply (a 30-day supply) is $30. This means that the amount you pay per day for your drug is $1. If you receive a 7 days’ supply of the drug, your payment will be $1 per day multiplied by 7 days, for a total payment of $7.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Daily cost-sharing allows you to make sure a drug works for you before you have to pay for an entire month’s supply. You can also ask your doctor to prescribe, and your pharmacist to dispense, less than a full month’s supply of a drug or drugs, if this will help you better plan refill dates for different prescriptions so that you can take fewer trips to the pharmacy. The amount you pay will depend upon the days’ supply you receive.</p>

<p><br />Our plan covers the following during the Coverage Gap Stage for drugs on Tier 1 & 2. Cost-sharing for a 30-day supply for drugs on each tier on which we provide gap coverage is listed below.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Cost-sharing at a network retail pharmacy that offers standard cost-sharing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1: $15</li>

<li>Tier 2: $20</li>
  </ul>
<p>Cost-sharing at a network retail pharmacy that offers preferred cost-sharing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1: $0</li>

<li>Tier 2: $0</li>
  </ul>
<p></p>
<p>For drugs on all other tiers when you are in the Coverage Gap Stage, the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program provides manufacturer discounts on brand name drugs. You pay 25% of the negotiated price and a portion of the dispensing fee for brand name drugs. Both the amount you pay and the amount discounted by the manufacturer count toward your out-of-pocket costs as if you had paid them and moves you through the coverage gap.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>You also receive some coverage for generic drugs. You pay no more than 25% of the cost for generic drugs and the plan pays the rest. For generic drugs, the amount paid by the plan (75%) does not count toward your out-of-pocket costs. Only the amount you pay counts and moves you through the coverage gap.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>You continue paying the discounted price for brand name drugs and no more than 25% of the costs of generic drugs until your yearly out-of-pocket payments reach a maximum amount that Medicare has set. In 2022, that amount is $7,050.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>Medicare has rules about what counts and what does <em>not</em> count as your out-of-pocket costs. When you reach an out-of-pocket limit of $7,050, you leave the Coverage Gap Stage and move on to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><br /><hr style="font-size: 14.6667px;" /><br /><strong>These payments <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are not included</span> in your out-of-pocket costs</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<p>When you add up your out-of-pocket costs, you are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> allowed to include</strong> any of these types of payments for prescription drugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drugs you buy outside the United States and its territories.</li>
<li>Drugs that are not covered by our plan.</li>
<li>Drugs you get at an out-of-network pharmacy that do not meet the plan’s requirements for out-of-network coverage.</li>

<li>Non-Part D drugs, including prescription drugs covered by Part A or Part B and other drugs excluded from coverage by Medicare.</li>

<li>Payments you make toward prescription drugs not normally covered in a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan.</li>
<li>Payments made by the plan for your brand or generic drugs while in the Coverage Gap.</li>
<li>Payments for your drugs that are made by group health plans including employer health plans.</li>
<li>Payments for your drugs that are made by certain insurance plans and government-funded health programs such as TRICARE and Veterans Affairs.</li>
<li>Payments for your drugs made by a third-party with a legal obligation to pay for prescription costs (for example, Workers’ Compensation).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Reminder</em>: If any other organization such as the ones listed above pays part or all of your out-of-pocket costs for drugs, you are required to tell our plan. Call Member Services to let us know (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).</p>

<p><em><strong>How can you keep track of your out-of-pocket total?</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We will help you.</strong> The <em>Part D Explanation of Benefits</em> (Part D EOB) summary we send to you includes the current amount of your out-of-pocket costs (Section 3 in this chapter tells about this report). When you reach a total of $7,050 in out-of-pocket costs for the year, this report will tell you that you have left the Coverage Gap Stage and have moved on to the Catastrophic Coverage Stage.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure we have the information we need.</strong> Section 3.2 tells what you can do to help make sure that our records of what you have spent are complete and up to date.</li>

<p><br />Our plan provides coverage for a number of Part D vaccines. We also cover vaccines that are considered medical benefits. You can find out about coverage of these vaccines by going to the Medical Benefits Chart in Chapter 4, Section 2.1.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>There are two parts to our coverage of Part D vaccinations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first part of coverage is the cost of <strong>the vaccine medication itself</strong>. The vaccine is a prescription medication.</li>
<li>The second part of coverage is for the cost of <strong>giving you the vaccine</strong>. (This is sometimes called the “administration” of the vaccine.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What do you pay for a Part D vaccination?<br /></strong>What you pay for a Part D vaccination depends on three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The type of vaccine</strong> (what you are being vaccinated for).</p>
<ul>
<li>Some vaccines are considered medical benefits. You can find out about your coverage of these vaccines by going to Chapter 4, <em>Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay).</em></li>
<li>Other vaccines are considered Part D drugs. You can find these vaccines listed in the plan’s <em>List of Covered Drugs (Formulary).</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Where you get the vaccine medication.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Who gives you the vaccine.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>What you pay at the time you get the Part D vaccination can vary depending on the circumstances. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes when you get your vaccine, you will have to pay the entire cost for both the vaccine medication and for getting the vaccine. You can ask our plan to pay you back for our share of the cost.</li>
<li>Other times, when you get the vaccine medication or the vaccine, you will pay only your share of the cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>To show how this works, here are three common ways you might get a Part D vaccine. Remember you are responsible for all of the costs associated with vaccines (including their administration) during the Deductible and Coverage Gap Stage of your benefit.</p>

<div> </div>
<p>Sometimes when you get medical care or a prescription drug, you may need to pay the full cost right away. Other times, you may find that you have paid more than you expected under the coverage rules of the plan. In either case, you can ask our plan to pay you back (paying you back is often called “reimbursing” you). It is your right to be paid back by our plan whenever you’ve paid more than your share of the cost for medical services  or drugs that are covered by our plan.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>There may also be times when you get a bill from a provider for the full cost of medical care you have received. In many cases, you should send this bill to us instead of paying it. We will look at the bill and decide whether the services should be covered. If we decide they should be covered, we will pay the provider directly.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>Here are examples of situations in which you may need to ask our plan to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>When you’ve received medical care from a provider who is not in our plan’s network</strong></p>
<div> When you received care from a provider who is not part of our network, you are only responsible for paying your share of the cost, not for the entire cost. (Your share of the cost may be higher for an out-of-network provider than for a network provider.) You should ask the provider to bill the plan for our share of the cost. <o:p></o:p></div>
<ul>
<li>If you pay the entire amount yourself at the time you receive the care, you need to ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost. Send us the bill, along with documentation of any payments you have made.</li>
<li>At times you may get a bill from the provider asking for payment that you think you do not owe. Send us this bill, along with documentation of any payments you have already made.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>If the provider is owed anything, we will pay the provider directly.</li>
<li>If you have already paid more than your share of the cost of the service, we will determine how much you owed and pay you back for our share of the cost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Please note:</strong> While you can get your care from an out-of-network provider, the provider must be eligible to participate in Medicare. Except for emergency care, we cannot pay a provider who is not eligible to participate in Medicare. If the provider is not eligible to participate in Medicare, you will be responsible for the full cost of the services you receive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When a network provider sends you a bill you think you should not pay</strong></p>
<p>Network providers should always bill the plan directly, and ask you only for your share of the cost. But sometimes they make mistakes, and ask you to pay more than your share.</p>
<ul>
<li>You only have to pay your cost-sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow providers to add additional separate charges, called “balance billing.” This protection (that you never pay more than your cost-sharing amount) applies even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don’t pay certain provider charges. For more information about “balance billing,” go to Chapter 4, Section 1.3.</li>
<li>Whenever you get a bill from a network provider that you think is more than you should pay, send us the bill. We will contact the provider directly and resolve the billing problem.</li>
<li>If you have already paid a bill to a network provider, but you feel that you paid too much, send us the bill along with documentation of any payment you have made and ask us to pay you back the difference between the amount you paid and the amount you owed under the plan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you are retroactively enrolled in our plan</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a person’s enrollment in the plan is retroactive. (Retroactive means that the first day of their enrollment has already passed. The enrollment date may even have occurred last year.)</p>
<p>If you were retroactively enrolled in our plan and you paid out-of-pocket for any of your covered services or drugs after your enrollment date, you can ask us to pay you back for our share of the costs. You will need to submit paperwork for us to handle the reimbursement.</p>
<p>Please call Member Services for additional information about how to ask us to pay you back and deadlines for making your request. (Phone numbers for Member Services are printed on the back cover of this booklet.)<span style="font-size: 11pt;"></span></p>
</li>
<li><strong>When you use an out-of-network pharmacy to get a prescription filled</strong><br />If you go to an out-of-network pharmacy and try to use your membership card to fill a prescription, the pharmacy may not be able to submit the claim directly to us. When that happens, you will have to pay the full cost of your prescription. (We cover prescriptions filled at out-of-network pharmacies only in a few special situations. Please go to Chapter 5, Section 2.5 to learn more.)
<p>Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong> When you pay the full cost for a prescription because you don’t have your plan membership card with you</strong></p>
<div>If you do not have your plan membership card with you, you can ask the pharmacy to call the plan or to look up your plan enrollment information. However, if the pharmacy cannot get the enrollment information they need right away, you may need to pay the full cost of the prescription yourself.</div>
<p>Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back for our share of the cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When you pay the full cost for a prescription in other situations</strong></p>
<div>You may pay the full cost of the prescription because you find that the drug is not covered for some reason.</div>
<ul>
<li>For example, the drug may not be on the plan’s <em>List of Covered Drugs (Formulary)</em>; or it could have a requirement or restriction that you didn’t know about or don’t think should apply to you. If you decide to get the drug immediately, you may need to pay the full cost for it.</li>
<li>Save your receipt and send a copy to us when you ask us to pay you back. In some situations, we may need to get more information from your doctor in order to pay you back for our share of the cost.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the examples above are types of coverage decisions. This means that if we deny your request for payment, you can appeal our decision.

<p><br />There are some situations when you should let us know about payments you have made for your drugs. In these cases, you are not asking us for payment. Instead, you are telling us about your payments so that we can calculate your out-of-pocket costs correctly. This may help you to qualify for the Catastrophic Coverage Stage more quickly.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>Here are two situations when you should send us copies of receipts to let us know about payments you have made for your drugs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>When you buy the drug for a price that is lower than our price</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes when you are in the <span style="color: #262626;  background-color: #ffffff;">Deductible Stage or </span> Coverage Gap Stage you can buy your drug <strong>at a network pharmacy</strong> for a price that is lower than our price.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, a pharmacy might offer a special price on the drug. Or you may have a discount card that is outside our benefit that offers a lower price.</li>
<li>Unless special conditions apply, you must use a network pharmacy in these situations and your drug must be on our Drug List.</li>
<li>Save your receipt and send a copy to us so that we can have your out-of-pocket expenses count toward qualifying you for the Catastrophic Coverage Stage.</li>
<li><strong>Please note:</strong> If you are in the <span style="color: #262626;  background-color: #ffffff;">Deductible Stage or </span> Coverage Gap Stage, we may not pay for any share of these drug costs. But sending a copy of the receipt allows us to calculate your out-of-pocket costs correctly and may help you qualify for the Catastrophic Coverage Stage more quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>When you get a drug through a patient assistance program offered by a drug manufacturer</strong></p>
<p>Some members are enrolled in a patient assistance program offered by a drug manufacturer that is outside the plan benefits. If you get any drugs through a program offered by a drug manufacturer, you may pay a copayment to the patient assistance program.</p>
<ul>
<li>Save your receipt and send a copy to us so that we can have your out-of-pocket expenses count toward qualifying you for the Catastrophic Coverage Stage.</li>
<li><strong>Please note:</strong> Because you are getting your drug through the patient assistance program and not through the plan’s benefits, we will not pay for any share of these drug costs. But sending a copy of the receipt allows us to calculate your out-of-pocket costs correctly and may help you qualify for the Catastrophic Coverage Stage more quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div>Since you are not asking for payment in the two cases described above, these situations are not considered coverage decisions. Therefore, you cannot make an appeal if you disagree with our decision.</div>

<br />Federal and state laws protect the privacy of your medical records and personal health information. We protect your personal health information as required by these laws. <br />
<ul>
<li>Your “personal health information” includes the personal information you gave us when you enrolled in this plan as well as your medical records and other medical and health information.</li>
<li>The laws that protect your privacy give you rights related to getting information and controlling how your health information is used. We give you a written notice, called a “Notice of Privacy Practice,” that tells about these rights and explains how we protect the privacy of your health information.</li>
</ul>
<strong>How do we protect the privacy of your health information?</strong><br />
<ul>
<li>We make sure that unauthorized people don’t see or change your records. </li>
<li>In most situations, if we give your health information to anyone who isn’t providing your care or paying for your care, <em>we are required to get written permission from you first.</em> Written permission can be given by you or by someone you have given legal power to make decisions for you. </li>
<li>There are certain exceptions that do not require us to get your written permission first. These exceptions are allowed or required by law. </li>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>For example, we are required to release health information to government agencies that are checking on quality of care. </li>
<li>Because you are a member of our plan through Medicare, we are required to give Medicare your health information  including information about your Part D prescription drugs. If Medicare releases your information for research or other uses, this will be done according to Federal statutes and regulations.</li>
</ul>

<strong>You can see the information in your records and know how it has been shared with others</strong> 
<p>You have the right to look at your medical records held at the plan, and to get a copy of your records. We are allowed to charge you a fee for making copies.

<p>This Notice of Privacy Practices applies to Aetna's insured health benefit plans.  It does not apply to any plans that are self-funded by an employer.  If you receive benefits through a group health insurance plan, your employer will be able to tell you if your plan is insured or self-funded.  If your plan is self-funded, you may want to ask for a copy of your employer's privacy notice.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>how medical information about you</em></strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>may be used and disclosed and how</em></strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>you can get access to this information.<br /></em></strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Please review it carefully.<br /></em></strong></div>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Aetna<sup>1</sup> considers personal information to be confidential.  We protect the privacy of that informati</span>on in accordance with federal and state privacy laws, as well as our own company privacy policies.<br /><br /></p>
<p>This notice describes how we may use and disclose information about you in administering your benefits, and it explains your legal rights regarding the information.<br /><br /></p>
<p>When we use the term “personal information,” we mean the information that identifies you as an individual, such as your name and Social Security number, as well as financial, health and other information about you that is nonpublic, and that we obtain so we can provide you with insurance coverage. By “health information,” we mean information that identifies you and relates to your medical history (i.e., the health care you receive or the amounts paid for that care).<br /><br /></p>
This notice became effective on October 9, 2018.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><sup>1</sup> For purposes of this notice, “Aetna” and the pronouns “we,” “us” and “our” refer to all of the HMO and licensed insurer subsidiaries of Aetna Inc., including but not limited to the entities listed on the last page of this notice.  These entities have been designated as a single affiliated covered entity for federal privacy purposes.</span><br />
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>How Aetna Uses and Discloses Personal Information</strong></span></p>
<p style="font-size: 14.6667px;">In order to provide you with insurance coverage, we need personal information about you, and we obtain that information from many different sources - particularly you, your employer or benefits plan sponsor if applicable, other insurers, HMOs or third-party administrators (TPAs), and health care providers. In administering your health benefits, we may use and disclose personal information about you in various ways, including:<br /><br /></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 11pt;">Health Care Operations:</strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> We may use and disclose personal information during the course of running our health business – that is, during operational activities such as quality assessment and improvement; licensing; accreditation by independent organizations; performance measurement and outcomes assessment; health services research; and preventive health, disease management, case management and care coordination. For example, we may use the information to provide disease management programs for members with specific conditions, such as diabetes, asthma or heart failure. Other operational activities requiring use and disclosure include administration of reinsurance and stop loss; underwriting and rating; detection and investigation of fraud; administration of pharmaceutical programs and payments; transfer of policies or contracts from and to other health plans; facilitation of a sale, transfer, merger or consolidation of all or part of Aetna with another entity (including due diligence related to such activity); and other general administrative activities, including data and information systems management, and customer service.<br /></span></p>
<div><strong><br />Payment:</strong> To help pay for your covered services, we may use and disclose personal information in a number of ways – in conducting utilization and medical necessity reviews; coordinating care; determining eligibility; determining formulary compliance; collecting premiums; calculating cost-sharing amounts; and responding to complaints, appeals and requests for external review. For example, we may use your medical history and other health information about you to decide whether a particular treatment is medically necessary and what the payment should be – and during the process, we may disclose information to your provider. We also mail Explanation of Benefits forms and other information to the address we have on record for the subscriber (i.e., the primary insured). In addition, we make claims information contained on our secure member website and telephonic claims status sites available to the subscriber and all covered dependents. We also use personal information to obtain payment for any mail order pharmacy services provided to you. <br /><br /></div>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Treatment:</span></strong> We may disclose information to doctors, dentists, pharmacies, hospitals and other health care providers who take care of you. For example, doctors may request medical information from us to supplement their own records. We also may use personal information in providing mail order pharmacy services and by sending certain information to doctors for patient safety or other treatment-related reasons.<br /><br /></p>
<div><strong>Disclosures to Other Covered Entities:</strong> We may disclose personal information to other covered entities, or business associates of those entities for treatment, payment and certain health care operations purposes. For example, if you receive benefits through a group health insurance plan, we may disclose personal information to other health plans maintained by your employer if it has been arranged for us to do so in order to have certain expenses reimbursed.<br /><br /></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Additional Reasons for Disclosure</strong></span></div>
<div>We may use or disclose personal information about you in providing you with treatment alternatives, treatment reminders, or other health-related benefits and services. We also may disclose such information in support of:</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan Administration</strong> (Group Plans) – to your employer, as applicable, when we have been informed that appropriate language has been included in your plan documents, or when summary data is disclosed to assist in bidding or amending a group health plan.</li>
<li><strong>Research </strong>– to researchers, provided measures are taken to protect your privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Business Associates</strong> – to persons who provide services to us and assure us they will protect the information.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Regulation</strong> – to Government agencies that regulate us (different countries and U.S. state insurance departments).</li>
<li><strong>Workers’ Compensation</strong> – to comply with workers’ compensation laws.</li>
<li><strong>Law Enforcement</strong> – to Government law enforcement officials.</li>
<li><strong>Legal Proceedings</strong> – in response to a court order or other lawful process.</li>
<li><strong>Public Welfare</strong> – to address matters of public interest as required or permitted by law (e.g., child abuse and neglect, threats to public health and safety, and national security).</li>
<li><strong>As Required by Law</strong> – to comply with legal obligations and requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Decedents</strong> – to a coroner or medical examiner for the purpose of identifying a deceased person, determining a cause of death, or as authorized by law; and to funeral directors as necessary to carry out their duties.</li>
<li><strong>Organ Procurement</strong> – to respond to organ donation groups for the purpose of facilitating organ donation and transplantation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Required Disclosures:</strong> We<strong> must</strong> use and disclose your personal information in the following manner:</p>
<ul>
<li>To you or someone who has the legal right to act for you (your personal representative) in order to administer your rights as described in this notice; and</li>
<li>To the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, as necessary, for HIPAA compliance and enforcement purposes.</li>
</ul>
<strong style="font-size: 12pt;">Disclosure to Others Involved in Your Health Care</strong>
<p>We may disclose health information about you to a relative, a friend, the subscriber of your health benefits plan or any other person you identify, provided the information is directly relevant to that person’s involvement with your health care or payment for that care. For example, if a family member or a caregiver calls us with prior knowledge of a claim, we may confirm whether or not the claim has been received and paid. You have the right to stop or limit this kind of disclosure by calling the toll-free Member Services number on your ID card.<br /><br />If you are a minor, you also may have the right to block parental access to your health information in certain circumstances, if permitted by state law. You can contact us using the toll-free Member Services number on your ID card – or have your provider contact us.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Uses and Disclosures Requiring Your Written Authorization<br /></strong></span>In all situations other than those described above, we will ask for your written authorization before using or disclosing personal information about you. For example, we will get your authorization:</p>
<ul>
<li>for marketing purposes that are unrelated to your benefit plan(s),</li>
<li>before disclosing any psychotherapy notes,</li>
<li>related to the sale of your health information, and </li>
<li>for other reasons as required by law.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have given us an authorization, you may revoke it at any time, if we have not already acted on it. If you have questions regarding authorizations, please call the toll-free Member Services number on your ID card.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Your Legal Rights</strong></span><br />The federal privacy regulations give you several rights regarding your health information:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have the right to ask us to communicate with you in a certain way or at a certain location. For example, if you are covered as an adult dependent, you might want us to send health information (e.g. Explanation of benefits (EOB) and other claim information) to a different address from that of your subscriber.  We will accommodate reasonable requests.</li>
<li>You have the right to ask us to restrict the way we use or disclose health information about you in connection with health care operations, payment and treatment. We will consider, but may not agree to, such requests.  You also have the right to ask us to restrict disclosures to persons involved in your health care.</li>
<li>You have the right to ask us to obtain a copy of health information that is contained in a “designated record set” – medical records and other records maintained and used in making enrollment, payment, claims adjudication, medical management and other decisions.  We may ask you to make your request in writing, may charge a reasonable fee for producing and mailing the copies and, in certain cases, may deny the request.</li>
<li>You have the right to ask us to amend health information that is in a “designated record set.” Your request must be in writing and must include the reason for the request.  If we deny the request, you may file a written statement of disagreement.</li>
<li>You have the right to ask us to provide a list of certain disclosures we have made about you, such as disclosures of health information to government agencies that license us.  Your request must be in writing.  If you request such an accounting more than once in a 12-month period, we may charge a reasonable fee.</li>
<li>You have the right to be notified following a breach involving your health information.</li>
<li>You have the right to know the reasons for an unfavorable underwriting decision.  Previous unfavorable underwriting decisions may not be used as the basis for future underwriting decisions unless we make an independent evaluation of the basic facts.  Your genetic information cannot be used for underwriting purposes.</li>
<li>You have the right with very limited exceptions, not to be subjected to pretext interviews.<sup>2</sup></li>

<strong><br />You have the right to know your treatment options and participate in decisions about your health care</strong>
<p>You have the right to get full information from your doctors and other health care providers when you go for medical care. Your providers must explain your medical condition and your treatment choices <em>in a way that you can understand.<br /> </em></p>
<p>You also have the right to participate fully in decisions about your health care. To help you make decisions with your doctors about what treatment is best for you, your rights include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To know about all of your choices.</strong> This means that you have the right to be told about all of the treatment options that are recommended for your condition, no matter what they cost or whether they are covered by our plan. It also includes being told about programs our plan offers to help members manage their medications and use drugs safely.</li>
<li><strong>To know about the risks.</strong> You have the right to be told about any risks involved in your care. You must be told in advance if any proposed medical care or treatment is part of a research experiment. You always have the choice to refuse any experimental treatments. </li>
<li><strong>The right to say “no.”</strong> You have the right to refuse any recommended treatment. This includes the right to leave a hospital or other medical facility, even if your doctor advises you not to leave. You also have the right to stop taking your medication. Of course, if you refuse treatment or stop taking medication, you accept full responsibility for what happens to your body as a result.</li>
<li><strong>To receive an explanation if you are denied coverage for care.</strong> You have the right to receive an explanation from us if a provider has denied care that you believe you should receive. To receive this explanation, you will need to ask us for a coverage decision. Chapter 9 of this booklet tells how to ask the plan for a coverage decision.</li>
</ul>
<strong>You have the right to give instructions about what is to be done if you are not able to make medical decisions for yourself</strong>
<p>Sometimes people become unable to make health care decisions for themselves due to accidents or serious illness. You have the right to say what you want to happen if you are in this situation. This means that, <em>if you want to, </em>you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fill out a written form to give <strong>someone the legal authority to make medical decisions for you</strong> if you ever become unable to make decisions for yourself. </li>
<li><strong>Give your doctors written instructions</strong> about how you want them to handle your medical care if you become unable to make decisions for yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>The legal documents that you can use to give your directions in advance in these situations are called <strong>“advance directives.”</strong> There are different types of advance directives and different names for them. Documents called <strong>“living will”</strong> and <strong>“power of attorney for health care”</strong> are examples of advance directives.</p>
<p><br />If you want to use an “advance directive” to give your instructions, here is what to do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Get the form.</strong> If you want to have an advance directive, you can get a form from your lawyer, from a social worker, or from some office supply stores. You can sometimes get advance directive forms from organizations that give people information about Medicare. </li>
<li><strong>Fill it out and sign it.</strong> Regardless of where you get this form, keep in mind that it is a legal document. You should consider having a lawyer help you prepare it.</li>
<li><strong>Give copies to appropriate people.</strong> You should give a copy of the form to your doctor and to the person you name on the form as the one to make decisions for you if you can’t. You may want to give copies to close friends or family members as well. Be sure to keep a copy at home.</li>
</ul>
If you know ahead of time that you are going to be hospitalized, and you have signed an advance directive, <strong>take a copy with you to the hospital.</strong> <br />
<ul>
<li>If you are admitted to the hospital, they will ask you whether you have signed an advance directive form and whether you have it with you. </li>
<li>If you have not signed an advance directive form, the hospital has forms available and will ask if you want to sign one.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Remember, it is your choice whether you want to fill out an advance directive</strong> (including whether you want to sign one if you are in the hospital). According to law, no one can deny you care or discriminate against you based on whether or not you have signed an advance directive.<br /><strong><br />What if your instructions are not followed?</strong><br />If you have signed an advance directive, and you believe that a doctor or hospital did not follow the instructions in it, you may file a complaint with the state agency that oversees advance directives. To find the appropriate agency in your state, contact your SHIP. Contact information is in <strong>Addendum A</strong> at the back of this booklet.

<br />Things you need to do as a member of the plan are listed below. If you have any questions, please call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). We’re here to help.<br />
<ul>
<li><strong>Get familiar with your covered services and the rules you must follow to get these covered services.</strong> Use this <em>Evidence of Coverage </em>booklet to learn what is covered for you and the rules you need to follow to get your covered services.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Chapters 3 and 4 give the details about your medical services, including what is covered, what is not covered, rules to follow, and what you pay. </li>
<li>Chapters 5 and 6 give the details about your coverage for Part D prescription drugs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>If you have any other health insurance coverage or prescription drug coverage in addition to our plan, you are required to tell us.</strong> Please call Member Services to let us know (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). </li>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>We are required to follow rules set by Medicare to make sure that you are using all of your coverage in combination when you get your covered services from our plan. This is called <strong>“coordination of benefits”</strong> because it involves coordinating the health and drug benefits you get from our plan with any other health and drug benefits available to you. We’ll help you coordinate your benefits. (For more information about coordination of benefits, go to Chapter 1, Section 10.)</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>Tell your doctor and other health care providers that you are enrolled in our plan.</strong> Show your plan membership card whenever you get your medical care or Part D prescription drugs. </li>
<li><strong>Help your doctors and other providers help you by giving them information, asking questions, and following through on your care. </strong></li>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>To help your doctors and other health providers give you the best care, learn as much as you are able to about your health problems and give them the information they need about you and your health. Follow the treatment plans and instructions that you and your doctors agree upon. </li>
<li>Make sure your doctors know all of the drugs you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and supplements.</li>
<li>If you have any questions, be sure to ask. Your doctors and other health care providers are supposed to explain things in a way you can understand. If you ask a question and you don’t understand the answer you are given, ask again.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong style="font-size: 11pt;">Be considerate.</strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> We expect all our members to respect the rights of other patients. We also expect you to act in a way that helps the smooth running of your doctor’s office, hospitals, and other offices.</span></li>
<li><strong>Pay what you owe.</strong> As a plan member, you are responsible for these payments:</li>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>In order to be eligible for our plan, you must have Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B. Some plan members must pay a premium for Medicare Part A. Most plan members must pay a premium for Medicare Part B to remain a member of the plan.</li>
<li>For most of your medical services or drugs covered by the plan, you must pay your share of the cost when you get the service or drug. This will be a copayment (a fixed amount) or coinsurance (a percentage of the total cost). Chapter 4 tells what you must pay for your medical services. Chapter 6 tells what you must pay for your Part D prescription drugs.
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>If you get any medical services or drugs<span style="font-size: 11pt;"> that are not covered by our plan or by other insurance you may have, you must pay the full cost. </span></li>
<li>If you disagree with our decision to deny coverage for a service or drug, you can make an appeal. Please see Chapter 9 of this booklet for information about how to make an appeal.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>If you are required to pay the extra amount for Part D because of your yearly income, you must pay the extra amount directly to the government to remain a member of the plan.</li>

<li><strong>Tell us if you move.</strong> If you are going to move, it’s important to tell us right away. Call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). 
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>If you move <em>outside</em> of our plan service area, you cannot remain a member of our plan.</strong> (Chapter 1 tells about our service area.) We can help you figure out whether you are moving outside our service area. If you are leaving our service area, you will have a Special Enrollment Period when you can join any Medicare plan available in your new area. We can let you know if we have a plan in your new area.</li>
<li><strong>If you move <em>within</em> our service area, we still need to know</strong> so we can keep your membership record up to date and know how to contact you.</li>
<li>If you move, it is also important to tell Social Security (or the Railroad Retirement Board). You can find phone numbers and contact information for these organizations in Chapter 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Call Member Services for help if you have questions or concerns.</strong> We also welcome any suggestions you may have for improving our plan.

<p><br />This chapter explains two types of processes for handling problems and concerns:</p>
<ul>
<li>For some types of problems, you need to use the <strong>process for coverage decisions and appeals.</strong></li>
<li>For other types of problems, you need to use the <strong>process for making complaints.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these processes have been approved by Medicare. To ensure fairness and prompt handling of your problems, each process has a set of rules, procedures, and deadlines that must be followed by us and by you.<br /><br />Which one do you use? That depends on the type of problem you are having. The guide in Section 3 will help you identify the right process to use.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><br />There are technical legal terms for some of the rules, procedures, and types of deadlines explained in this chapter. Many of these terms are unfamiliar to most people and can be hard to understand.<br /><br />To keep things simple, this chapter explains the legal rules and procedures using simpler words in place of certain legal terms. For example, this chapter generally says “making a complaint” rather than “filing a grievance,” “coverage decision” rather than “organization determination,” or “coverage determination” or “at-risk determination,” and “Independent Review Organization” instead of “Independent Review Entity.” It also uses abbreviations as little as possible.<br /><br />However, it can be helpful – and sometimes quite important – for you to know the correct legal terms for the situation you are in. Knowing which terms to use will help you communicate more clearly and accurately when you are dealing with your problem and get the right help or information for your situation. To help you know which terms to use, we include legal terms when we give the details for handling specific types of situations.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br />Sometimes it can be confusing to start or follow through the process for dealing with a problem. This can be especially true if you do not feel well or have limited energy. Other times, you may not have the knowledge you need to take the next step.</p>
<br /><strong>Get help from an independent government organization<br /></strong>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">We are always available to help you. But in some situations you may also want help or guidance from someone who is not connected with us. You can always contact your <strong>State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP)</strong>. This government program has trained counselors in every state. The program is not connected with us or with any insurance company or health plan. The counselors at this program can help you understand which process you should use to handle a problem you are having. They can also answer your questions, give you more information, and offer guidance on what to do.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">The services of SHIP counselors are free. You will find phone numbers in <strong>Addendum A</strong> at the back of this booklet.</span><br /><br /><strong style="font-size: 11pt;">You can also get help and information from Medicare<br /></strong><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">For more information and help in handling a problem, you can also contact Medicare.

<p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><br />The process for coverage decisions and appeals deals with problems related to your benefits and coverage for medical services and prescription drugs, including problems related to payment. This is the process you use for issues such as whether something is covered or not and the way in which something is covered.<br /><br /></span><strong style="font-size: 11pt;">Asking for coverage decisions</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">A coverage decision is a decision we make about your benefits and coverage or about the amount we will pay for your medical services or drugs. For example, your plan network doctor makes a (favorable) coverage decision for you whenever you receive medical care from him or her or if your network doctor refers you to a medical specialist. You or your doctor can also contact us and ask for a coverage decision if your doctor is unsure whether we will cover a particular medical service or refuses to provide medical care you think that you need. In other words, if you want to know if we will cover a medical service before you receive it, you can ask us to make a coverage decision for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><br />We are making a coverage decision for you whenever we decide what is covered for you and how much we pay. In some cases we might decide a service or drug is not covered or is no longer covered by Medicare for you. If you disagree with this coverage decision, you can make an appeal.</span></p>
<br /><strong>Making an appeal<br /></strong>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If we make a coverage decision and you are not satisfied with this decision, you can “appeal” the decision. An appeal is a formal way of asking us to review and change a coverage decision we have made.<br /></span><br /><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">When you appeal a decision for the first time, this is called a Level 1 Appeal. In this appeal, we review the coverage decision we made to check to see if we were following all of the rules properly. Your appeal is handled by different reviewers than those who made the original unfavorable decision. When we have completed the review, we give you our decision. Under certain circumstances, which we discuss later, you can request an expedited or “fast coverage decision” or fast appeal of a coverage decision.</span><br /></span><br /><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If we say no to all or part of your Level 1 Appeal, you can go on to a Level 2 Appeal. The Level 2 Appeal is conducted by an Independent Review Organization that is not connected to us. (In some situations, your case will be automatically sent to the Independent Review Organization for a Level 2 Appeal. In other situations, you will need to ask for a Level 2 Appeal.) If you are not satisfied with the decision at the Level 2 Appeal, you may be able to continue through additional levels of appeal.<br /><br /></span></p>

<p><br />Would you like some help? Here are resources you may wish to use if you decide to ask for any kind of coverage decision or appeal a decision:</p>
<ul>
<li>You <strong>can call us at Member Services</strong> (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet).</li>
<li>You <strong>can get free help from your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP)</strong> (see Section 2 of this chapter).</li>
<li><strong>Your doctor can make a request for you. </strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>For medical care or Part B prescription drugs, your doctor can request a coverage decision or a Level 1 Appeal on your behalf. If your appeal is denied at Level 1, it will be automatically forwarded to Level 2. To request any appeal after Level 2, your doctor must be appointed as your representative.</li>

<li>For Part D prescription drugs, your doctor or other prescriber can request a coverage decision or a Level 1 or Level 2 Appeal on your behalf. To request any appeal after Level 2, your doctor or other prescriber must be appointed as your representative.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>You can ask someone to act on your behalf</strong>. If you want to, you can name another person to act for you as your “representative” to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal.
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>There may be someone who is already legally authorized to act as your representative under State law.</li>
<li>If you want a friend, relative, your doctor or other provider, or other person to be your representative, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) and ask for the “Appointment of Representative” form. (The form is also available on Medicare’s website at <a href="http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/downloads/cms1696.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/downloads/cms1696.pdf</a>.) The form gives that person permission to act on your behalf. It must be signed by you and by the person who you would like to act on your behalf. You must give us a copy of the signed form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>You also have the right to hire a lawyer to act for you</strong>. You may contact your own lawyer, or get the name of a lawyer from your local bar association or other referral service. There are also groups that will give you free legal services if you qualify. However, <strong>you are not required to hire a lawyer</strong> to ask for any kind of coverage decision or appeal a decision.</li>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><br />This section is about your benefits for medical care and services. These benefits are described in Chapter 4 of this booklet: <em>Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)</em>. To keep things simple, we generally refer to “medical care coverage” or “medical care” in the rest of this section, instead of repeating “medical care or treatment or services” every time. The term “medical care” includes medical items and services as well as Medicare Part B prescription drugs. In some cases, different rules apply to a request for a Part B prescription drug. In those cases, we will explain how the rules for Part B prescription drugs are different from the rules for medical items and services.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><br />This section tells what you can do if you are in any of the five following situations:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>You are not getting certain medical care you want, and you believe that this care is covered by our plan.</li>
<li>Our plan will not approve the medical care your doctor or other medical provider wants to give you, and you believe that this care is covered by the plan.</li>
<li>You have received medical care that you believe should be covered by the plan, but we have said we will not pay for this care.</li>
<li>You have received and paid for medical care that you believe should be covered by the plan, and you want to ask our plan to reimburse you for this care.</li>
<li>You are being told that coverage for certain medical care you have been getting that we previously approved will be reduced or stopped, and you believe that reducing or stopping this care could harm your health.</li>
<ul>
<li>NOTE: <strong>If the coverage that will be stopped is for hospital care, home health care, skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services</strong>, you need to read a separate section of this chapter because special rules apply to these types of care. Here’s what to read in those situations:<br />
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Chapter 9, Section 7: <em>How to ask us to cover a longer inpatient hospital stay if you think the doctor is discharging you too soon.</em> </li>
<li>Chapter 9, Section 8: <em>How to ask us to keep covering certain medical services if you think your coverage is ending too soon</em>. This section is about three services only: home health care, skilled nursing facility care, and Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For <em>all other</em> situations that involve being told that medical care you have been getting will be stopped, use this section (Section 5) as your guide for what to do.</li>
</ul>

<p class="StepHeading"><strong><em>How to request coverage for the medical care you want<br /></em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">Start by calling, writing, or faxing our plan to make your request for us to authorize or provide coverage for the medical care you want. You, your doctor, or your representative can do this.</span></li>
<li>For the details on how to contact us, go to Chapter 2, Section 1 and look for the section called, <em>How to contact us when you are asking for a coverage decision about your medical care.</em></li>
</ul>
<p class="StepHeading"><strong><em>Generally, we use the standard deadlines for giving you our decision<br /></em></strong><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">When we give you our decision, we will use the “standard” deadlines unless we have agreed to use the “fast” deadlines. <strong>A standard coverage decision means we will give you an answer within 14 calendar days</strong> after we receive your request <strong>for a medical item or service</strong>. If your request is for a<strong> Medicare Part B prescription drug, we will give you an answer within 72 hours</strong> after we receive your request.<br /></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>However</strong>, for a request <strong>for a medical item or service we can take up to 14 more calendar days</strong> if you ask for more time, or if we need information (such as medical records from out-of-network providers) that may benefit you. If we decide to take extra days to make the decision, we will tell you in writing. We can’t take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug.</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">If you believe we should <em>not</em> take extra days, you can file a “fast complaint” about our decision to take extra days. When you file a fast complaint, we will give you an answer to your complaint within 24 hours. (The process for making a complaint is different from the process for coverage decisions and appeals. For more information about the process for making complaints, including fast complaints, see Section 10 of this chapter.) </span></li>
</ul>
<em><strong>If your health requires it, ask us to give you a “fast coverage decision”<br /></strong></em>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">A fast coverage decision means we will answer within 72 hours if your request is for a medical item or service. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug, we will answer within 24 hours.</span></strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>However</strong>, for a request <strong>for a medical item or service we can take up to 14 more calendar days</strong> if we find that some information that may benefit you is missing (such as medical records from out-of-network providers), or if you need time to get information to us for the review. If we decide to take extra days, we will tell you in writing. We can’t take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">If you believe we should <em>not</em> take extra days, you can file a “fast complaint” about our decision to take extra days. (For more information about the </span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">process for making complaints, including fast complaints, see Section 10 of this chapter.) We will call you as soon as we make the decision.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">To get a fast coverage decision, you must meet two requirements:</span></strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">You can get a fast coverage decision <em>only</em> if you are asking for coverage for medical care <em>you have not yet received</em>. (You cannot ask for a fast coverage decision if your request is about payment for medical care you have already received.)</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">You can get a fast coverage decision <em>only</em> if using the standard deadlines could <em>cause serious harm to your health or hurt your ability to function.</em></span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If your doctor tells us that your health requires a “fast coverage decision,” we will automatically agree to give you a fast coverage decision.</span></strong></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own, without your doctor’s support, we will decide whether your health requires that we give you a fast coverage decision.</span>
<ul>
<li>If we decide that your medical condition does not meet the requirements for a fast coverage decision, we will send you a letter that says so (and we will use the standard deadlines instead).</li>
<li>This letter will tell you that if your doctor asks for the fast coverage decision, we will automatically give a fast coverage decision.</li>
<li>The letter will also tell how you can file a “fast complaint” about our decision to give you a standard coverage decision instead of the fast coverage decision you requested. (For more information about the process for making complaints, including fast complaints, see Section 10 of this chapter.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 2:</span> We consider your request for medical care coverage and give you our answer.</strong></div>
<div><strong><br /><em>Deadlines for a “fast” coverage decision<br /></em></strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Generally, for a fast coverage decision on a request for a medical item or service, we will give you our answer <strong>within 72 hours</strong>. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug, we will answer <strong>within 24 hours</strong>.
<ul>
<li>As explained above, we can take up to 14 more calendar days under certain circumstances. If we decide to take extra days to make the coverage decision, we will tell you in writing. We can't take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug.</li>
<li>If you believe we should <em>not</em> take extra days, you can file a “fast complaint” about our decision to take extra days. When you file a fast complaint, we will give you an answer to your complaint within 24 hours. (For more information about the process for making complaints, including fast complaints, see Section 10 of this chapter.)</li>
<li>If we do not give you our answer within 72 hours (or if there is an extended time period, by the end of that period), or 24 hours if your request is for a Part B prescription drug, you have the right to appeal. Section 5.3 below tells how to make an appeal. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested</strong>, we will send you a detailed written explanation as to why we said no.</li>
</ul>
<em><strong>Deadlines for a “standard coverage decision”<br /></strong></em>
<ul>
<li>Generally, for a standard coverage decision on a request for a medical item or service, we will give you our answer <strong>within 14 calendar days of receiving your request</strong>. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug, we will give you an answer <strong>within 72 hours</strong> of receiving your request.
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">For a request for a medical item or service, we can take up to 14 more calendar days (“an extended time period”) under certain circumstances. If we decide to take extra days to make the coverage decision, we will tell you in writing. We can’t take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">If you believe we should <em>not</em> take extra days, you can file a “fast complaint” about our decision to take extra days.

Section 5.3 below tells how to make an appeal.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><strong>If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested</strong>, we will send you a written statement that explains why we said no.</span></li>
</ul>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 3:</span> If we say no to your request for coverage for medical care, you decide if you want to make an appeal.<br /></strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If we say no, you have the right to ask us to reconsider – and perhaps change – this decision by making an appeal. Making an appeal means making another try to get the medical care coverage you want.<br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If you decide to make an appeal, it means you are going on to Level 1 of the appeals process (see Section 5.3 below). </span></li>

<strong>    <em>What to do</em></strong><br />
<ul>
<li><strong>To start an appeal you, your doctor, or your representative, must contact us</strong>. For details on how to reach us for any purpose related to your appeal, go to Chapter 2, Section 1 and look for the section called, <em>How to contact us when you are making an appeal about your medical care.</em></li>
<li><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt;">If you are asking for a standard appeal, make your standard appeal in writing by submitting a request.</span></strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If you have someone appealing our decision for you other than your doctor, your appeal must include an Appointment of Representative form authorizing this person to represent you. To get the form, call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet) and ask for the “Appointment of Representative” form. It is also available on Medicare’s website at <a href="http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/downloads/cms1696.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS-Forms/CMS-Forms/downloads/cms1696.pdf</a>. While we can accept an appeal request without the form, we cannot begin or complete our review until we receive it. If we do not receive the form within 44 calendar days after receiving your appeal request (our deadline for making a decision on your appeal), your appeal request will be dismissed. If this happens, we will send you a written notice explaining your right to ask the Independent Review Organization to review our decision to dismiss your appeal.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>If you are asking for a fast appeal, make your appeal in writing or call us</strong> at the phone number shown in Chapter 2, Section 1 (<em>How to contact us when you are making an appeal about your medical care</em>). </li>
<li><strong>You must make your appeal request within 60 calendar days</strong> from the date on the written notice we sent to tell you our answer to your request for a coverage decision. If you miss this deadline and have a good reason for missing it, explain the reason your appeal is late when you make your appeal. We may give you more time to make your appeal. Examples of good cause for missing the deadline may include if you had a serious illness that prevented you from contacting us or if we provided you with incorrect or incomplete information about the deadline for requesting an appeal.</li>
<li><strong><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">You can ask for a copy of the information regarding your medical decision and add more information to support your appeal.</span></strong>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">You have the right to ask us for a copy of the information regarding your appeal.</span></li>

<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">The requirements and procedures for getting a “fast appeal” are the same as those for getting a “fast coverage decision.” To ask for a fast appeal, follow the instructions for asking for a fast coverage decision.

<ul>
<li><strong>The Independent Review Organization is an independent organization that is hired by Medicare</strong>. This organization is not connected with us and it is not a government agency. This organization is a company chosen by Medicare to handle the job of being the Independent Review Organization. Medicare oversees its work.</li>
<li>We will send the information about your appeal to this organization. This information is called your “case file.” <strong>You have the right to ask us for a copy of your case file</strong>.</li>
<li>You have a right to give the Independent Review Organization additional information to support your appeal.</li>
<li>Reviewers at the Independent Review Organization will take a careful look at all of the information related to your appeal.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><strong><em>If you had a “fast appeal” at Level 1, you will also have a “fast appeal” at Level 2</em></strong></span><br />
<ul>
<li>If you had a fast appeal to our plan at Level 1, you will automatically receive a fast appeal at Level 2. The review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 Appeal <strong>within 72 hours</strong> of when it receives your appeal.</li>
<li>However, if your request is for a medical item or service and the Independent Review Organization needs to gather more information that may benefit you, <strong>it can take</strong> <strong>up to 14 more calendar days</strong>. The Independent Review Organization can’t take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug.</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>If you had a “standard appeal” at Level 1, you will also have a “standard appeal” at Level 2</em></strong><br />
<ul>
<li>If you had a standard appeal to our plan at Level 1, you will automatically receive a standard appeal at Level 2. If your request is for a medical item or service, the review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 Appeal <strong>within 30 calendar days</strong> of when it receives your appeal. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug, the review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 Appeal <strong>within 7 calendar days</strong> of when it receives your appeal.</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">However, if your request is for a medical item or service and the Independent Review Organization needs to gather more information that may benefit you, <strong>it can take up to 14 more calendar days</strong>. The Independent Review Organization can’t take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug.</span></li>
</ul>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 2:</span> The Independent Review Organization gives you their answer.<br /></strong>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">The Independent Review Organization will tell you its decision in writing and explain the reasons for it.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If the review organization says yes to part or all of a request for a medical item or service</strong>, we must authorize the medical care coverage within 72 hours or provide the service <strong>within 14 calendar days</strong> after we receive the decision from the review organization for standard requests or within 72 hours from the date we receive the decision from the review organization for expedited requests.</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>If the review organization says yes to part or all of a request for a Medicare Part B prescription drug</strong>, we must authorize or provide the Part B prescription drug under dispute within <strong>72 hours</strong> after we receive the decision from the review organization for <strong>standard requests</strong> or within <strong>24 hours</strong> from the date we receive the decision from the review organization for <strong>expedited requests</strong>.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>If this organization says no to part or all of your appeal</strong>, it means they agree with us that your request (or part of your request) for coverage for medical care should not be approved. (This is called “upholding the decision.” It is also called “turning down your appeal.”)</span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 11pt;">If the Independent Review Organization “upholds the decision” you have the right to a Level 3 Appeal. However, to make another appeal at Level 3, the dollar value of the medical care coverage you are requesting must meet a certain minimum. If the dollar value of the coverage you are requesting is too low, you cannot make another appeal, which means that the decision at Level 2 is final.

<p class="subheading"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><strong>Asking for reimbursement is asking for a coverage decision from us<br /></strong></span>If you send us the paperwork that asks for reimbursement, you are asking us to make a coverage decision (for more information about coverage decisions, see Section 4.1 of this chapter). To make this coverage decision, we will check to see if the medical care you paid for is a covered service (see Chapter 4: <em>Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay)</em>). We will also check to see if you followed all the rules for using your coverage for medical care (these rules are given in Chapter 3 of this booklet: <em>Using the plan’s coverage for your medical services</em>).</p>

<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If the medical care you paid for is covered and you followed all the rules, we will send you the payment for our share of the cost of your medical care within 60 calendar days after we receive your request. Or, if you haven’t paid for the services, we will send the payment directly to the provider. (When we send the payment, it’s the same as saying <em>yes</em> to your request for a coverage decision.) </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If the medical care is <em>not</em> covered, or you did <em>not</em> follow all the rules, we will not send payment.

<div><em><strong><br />    What to do<br /></strong></em></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Request the type of coverage decision you want.</strong> Start by calling, writing, or faxing us to make your request. You, your representative, or your doctor (or other prescriber) can do this. You can also access the coverage decision process through our website. For the details, go to Chapter 2, Section 1 and look for the section called, <em>How to contact us when you are asking for a coverage decision about your Part D prescription drugs.</em> Or if you are asking us to pay you back for a drug, go to the section called, <em>Where to send a request asking us to pay for our share of the cost for medical care or a drug you have received.</em></li>
<li><strong>You or your doctor or someone else who is acting on your behalf</strong> can ask for a coverage decision. Section 4 of this chapter tells how you can give written permission to someone else to act as your representative. You can also have a lawyer act on your behalf.</li>
<li><strong>If you want to ask us to pay you back for a drug</strong>, start by reading Chapter 7 of this booklet: <em>Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services or drugs</em>. Chapter 7 describes the situations in which you may need to ask for reimbursement. It also tells how to send us the paperwork that asks us to pay you back for our share of the cost of a drug you have paid for.</li>
<li><strong>If you are requesting an exception, provide the “supporting statement</strong>.” Your doctor or other prescriber must give us the medical reasons for the drug exception you are requesting. (We call this the “supporting statement.”) Your doctor or other prescriber can fax or mail the statement to us. Or your doctor or other prescriber can tell us on the phone and follow up by faxing or mailing a written statement if necessary. See Sections 6.2 and 6.3 for more information about exception requests.</li>
<li><strong>We must accept any written request</strong>, including a request submitted on the CMS Model Coverage Determination Request Form or on our plan’s form, which is available on our website. </li>

<li><strong>To get a fast coverage decision, you must meet two requirements:</strong>
<ul>
<li>You can get a fast coverage decision <em>only</em> if you are asking for a <em>drug you have not yet received</em>. (You cannot ask for fast coverage decision if you are asking us to pay you back for a drug you have already bought.)</li>
<li>You can get a fast coverage decision <em>only</em> if using the standard deadlines could <em>cause serious harm to your health or hurt your ability to function</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><font><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><strong>If your doctor or other prescriber tells us that your health requires a “fast coverage decision,” we will automatically agree to give you a fast coverage decision.</strong></span></font></li>
<li><font><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own (without your doctor’s or other prescriber’s support), we will decide whether your health requires that we give you a fast coverage decision.</span></font>
<ul>
<li><font>If we decide that your medical condition does not meet the requirements for a fast coverage decision, we will send you a letter that says so (and we will use the standard deadlines instead).</font></li>
<li><font>This letter will tell you that if your doctor or other prescriber asks for the fast coverage decision, we will automatically give a fast coverage decision.</font></li>
<li><font>The letter will also tell how you can file a complaint about our decision to give you a standard coverage decision instead of the fast coverage decision you requested. It tells how to file a “fast complaint,” which means you would get our answer to your complaint within 24 hours of receiving the complaint.

<li>If we do not meet this deadline, we are required to send your request on to Level 2 of the appeals process, where it will be reviewed by an Independent Review Organization. Later in this section, we talk about this review organization and explain what happens at Appeal Level 2.</li>

<li>If the review organization agrees to give you a “fast appeal,” the review organization must give you an answer to your Level 2 Appeal <strong>within 72 hours</strong> after it receives your appeal request.</li>

<p>If this organization says no to your appeal, it means the organization agrees with our decision not to approve your request. (This is called “upholding the decision.” It is also called “turning down your appeal.”)<br /><br />If the Independent Review Organization “upholds the decision” you have the right to a Level 3 Appeal. However, to make another appeal at Level 3, the dollar value of the drug coverage you are requesting must meet a minimum amount. If the dollar value of the drug coverage you are requesting is too low, you cannot make another appeal and the decision at Level 2 is final. The notice you get from the Independent Review Organization will tell you the dollar value that must be in dispute to continue with the appeals process.</p>

<ul>
<li>There are three additional levels in the appeals process after Level 2 (for a total of five levels of appeal).</li>
<li>If your Level 2 Appeal is turned down and you meet the requirements to continue with the appeals process, you must decide whether you want to go on to Level 3 and make a third appeal. If you decide to make a third appeal, the details on how to do this are in the written notice you got after your second appeal.</li>
<li>The Level 3 Appeal is handled by an Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator. Section 9 in this chapter tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process.</li>

Before you start, understand what you need to do and what the deadlines are.</span><br /></span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><strong>Follow the process</strong>. Each step in the first two levels of the appeals process is explained below.</li>
<li><strong>Meet the deadlines</strong>. The deadlines are important. Be sure that you understand and follow the deadlines that apply to things you must do.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for help if you need it</strong>. If you have questions or need help at any time, please call Member Services (phone numbers are printed on the back cover of this booklet). Or call your State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP), a government organization that provides personalized assistance (see <strong>Addendum A</strong> at the back of this booklet). </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>During a Level 1 Appeal, the Quality Improvement Organization reviews your appeal</strong>. It checks to see if your planned discharge date is medically appropriate for you.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 1:</span> Contact the Quality Improvement Organization for your state and ask for a “fast review” of your hospital discharge. You must act quickly.</strong><br /><br /><em><strong>      What is the Quality Improvement Organization?<br /></strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>This organization is a group of doctors and other health care professionals who are paid by the Federal government. These experts are not part of our plan. This organization is paid by Medicare to check on and help improve the quality of care for people with Medicare. This includes reviewing hospital discharge dates for people with Medicare.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><em><strong>     How can you contact this organization?</strong></em><br /></span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">The written notice you received (<em>An Important Message from Medicare About Your Rights</em>) tells you how to reach this organization. (Or find the name, address, and phone number of the Quality Improvement Organization for your state in <strong>Addendum A</strong> at the back of this booklet.)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><em><strong>    Act quickly:</strong></em></span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">To make your appeal, you must contact the Quality Improvement Organization <em>before</em> you leave the hospital and <strong>no later than midnight the day of your discharge.</strong> (Your “planned discharge date” is the date that has been set for you to leave the hospital.)</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If you meet this deadline, you are allowed to stay in the hospital <em>after</em> your discharge date <em>without paying for it</em> while you wait to get the decision on your appeal from the Quality Improvement Organization.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If you do <em>not</em> meet this deadline, and you decide to stay in the hospital after your planned discharge date, <em>you may have to pay all of the</em> <em>costs</em> for hospital care you receive after your planned discharge date.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If you miss the deadline for contacting the Quality Improvement Organization, and you still wish to appeal, you must make an appeal directly to our plan instead. For details about this other way to make your appeal, see Section 7.4.</span></li>
</ul>
<div><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">    <em><strong>Ask for a “fast review”:</strong></em></span></div>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">You must ask the Quality Improvement Organization for a <strong>“fast review”</strong> of your discharge.

<p><br />If the Quality Improvement Organization has turned down your appeal, <em>and</em> you stay in the hospital after your planned discharge date, then you can make a Level 2 Appeal. During a Level 2 Appeal, you ask the Quality Improvement Organization to take another look at the decision they made on your first appeal. If the Quality Improvement Organization turns down your Level 2 Appeal, you may have to pay the full cost for your stay after your planned discharge date.<br /><br />Here are the steps for Level 2 of the appeal process:</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 1:</span> You contact the Quality Improvement Organization again and ask for another review.<br /></span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">You must ask for this review <strong>within 60 calendar days</strong> after the day the Quality Improvement Organization said <em>no</em> to your Level 1 Appeal. You can ask for this review only if you stay in the hospital after the date that your coverage for the care ended.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 2:</span> The Quality Improvement Organization does a second review of your situation.<br /></strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">Reviewers at the Quality Improvement Organization will take another careful look at all of the information related to your appeal.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 3:</span> Within 14 calendar days of receipt of your request for a second review, the Quality Improvement Organization reviewers will decide on your appeal and tell you their decision.</strong><br /><br /><em><strong>    If the review organization says yes:<br /></strong></em></span></span></span>
<ul>
<li><font><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><strong>We must reimburse you</strong> for our share of the costs of hospital care you have received since noon on the day after the date your first appeal was turned down by the Quality Improvement Organization. <strong>We must continue providing coverage for your inpatient hospital care for as long as it is medically necessary.</strong></span></font></li>
<li>You must continue to pay your share of the costs and coverage limitations may apply.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><em><strong>    If the review organization says no:</strong></em><br /></span></span></span>
<ul>
<li>It means they agree with the decision they made on your Level 1 Appeal and will not change it. </li>
<li>The notice you get will tell you in writing what you can do if you wish to continue with the review process. It will give you the details about how to go on to the next level of appeal, which is handled by an Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator.</li>

<ul>
<li>There are three additional levels in the appeals process after Level 2 (for a total of five levels of appeal). If the review organization turns down your Level 2 Appeal, you can choose whether to accept that decision or whether to go on to Level 3 and make another appeal. At Level 3, your appeal is reviewed by an Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator.</li>

<p><br />If the Quality Improvement Organization has turned down your appeal <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> you choose to continue getting care after your coverage for the care has ended, then you can make a Level 2 Appeal. During a Level 2 Appeal, you ask the Quality Improvement Organization to take another look at the decision they made on your first appeal. If the Quality Improvement Organization turns down your Level 2 Appeal, you may have to pay the full cost for your home health care, or skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services<em> after</em> the date when we said your coverage would end.</p>
<p><br />Here are the steps for Level 2 of the appeal process:</p>
<br /><strong style="font-size: 11pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step 1:</span> You contact the Quality Improvement Organization again and ask for another review.<br /></strong></div>
<ul>

<p><br />This section may be appropriate for you if you have made a Level 1 Appeal and a Level 2 Appeal, and both of your appeals have been turned down.<br /><br />If the value of the drug you have appealed meets a certain dollar amount, you may be able to go on to additional levels of appeal. If the dollar amount is less, you cannot appeal any further. The written response you receive to your Level 2 Appeal will explain who to contact and what to do to ask for a Level 3 Appeal.<br /><br />For most situations that involve appeals, the last three levels of appeal work in much the same way. Here is who handles the review of your appeal at each of these levels.</p>

<td>The process of asking for a coverage decision and making appeals is explained in Sections 4-9 of this chapter. If you are asking for a coverage decision or making an appeal, you use that process, not the complaint process.<br /><br />However, if you have already asked us for a coverage decision or made an appeal, and you think that we are not responding quickly enough, you can also make a complaint about our slowness. Here are examples:
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If you have asked us to give you a “fast coverage decision” or a “fast appeal,” and we have said we will not, you can make a complaint.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If you believe we are not meeting the deadlines for giving you a coverage decision or an answer to an appeal you have made, you can make a complaint.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">When a coverage decision we made is reviewed and we are told that we must cover or reimburse you for certain medical services or drugs, there are deadlines that apply. If you think we are not meeting these deadlines, you can make a complaint.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">When we do not give you a decision on time, we are required to forward your case to the Independent Review Organization. If we do not do that within the required deadline, you can make a complaint.</span></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li><strong>Usually, calling Member Services is the first step</strong>. If there is anything else you need to do, Member Services will let you know. Member Services can be reached at 1-833-570-6670 or the number on the back of your ID card (TTY 711). Hours of operation are 8 AM to 8 PM, 7 days a week.</li>
<li><strong>If you do not wish to call (or you called and were not satisfied), you can put your complaint in writing and send it to us.</strong> If you put your complaint in writing, we will respond to your complaint in writing.</li>
<li>To use our grievance (complaint) process, you should call or send us your written complaint using one of the contact methods listed in Chapter 2: <em>Important Phone Numbers and Resources (How to contact us when you are making a complaint about your </em><em>Part D prescription drugs </em>or<em> medical care)</em>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Please be sure you provide all pertinent information, including any supporting documents you believe are appropriate. Your complaint must be received by us within 60 calendar days of the event or incident that resulted in you filing your complaint.</li>
<li>Your issue will be investigated by a member of our complaint team. If you submit your complaint verbally, we will inform you of the result of our review and our decision verbally or in writing. If you submit a verbal complaint and request your response to be in writing, we will respond in writing. If you send us a written complaint, we will send you a written response, stating the result of our review. Our notice will include a description of our understanding of your complaint and our decision in clear terms.</li>
<li>We must address your complaint as quickly as your case requires based on your health status, but no later than 30 calendar days after receiving your complaint. We may extend the timeframe by up to 14 calendar days if we justify a need for additional information and the delay is in your best interest.</li>
<li>You also have the right to ask for a fast “expedited” grievance. A fast “expedited” grievance is a type of complaint that must be resolved within 24 hours from the time you contact us. You have the right to request a fast “expedited” grievance if you disagree with:
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Our plan to take a 14-calendar-day extension on an organization/coverage determination or reconsideration/redetermination (appeal); or</li>
<li>Our denial of your request to expedite an organization determination or reconsideration (appeal) for health services; or</li>
<li>Our denial of your request to expedite a coverage determination or redetermination (appeal) for a prescription drug.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">The fast “expedited” grievance process is as follows:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li>You or an authorized representative can call, fax, or mail your complaint and mention that you want the fast complaint or expedited grievance process. Call the phone number, fax, or write your complaint and send it to the address listed in Chapter 2: <em>Important Phone Numbers and Resources (How to contact us when you’re making a complaint about your</em><em> Part D prescription drugs or</em> <em>medical care)</em>. The fastest way to submit a fast complaint is to call or fax us. The fastest way to file a grievance is to call us. When we receive your complaint, we will promptly investigate the issue you have identified. If we agree with your complaint, we will cancel the 14-calendar-day extension, or expedite the determination or appeal as you originally requested. Regardless of whether we agree or not, we will investigate your complaint and notify you of our decision within 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"><strong>Whether you call or write, you should contact Member Services right away</strong>. The complaint must be made within 60 calendar days after you had the problem you want to complain about. </span></li>
<li><strong><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;">If you are making a complaint because we denied your request for a “fast coverage decision” or a “fast appeal,” we will automatically give you a “fast complaint.”</span></strong><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"> If you have a “fast complaint,” it means we will give you</span><strong><span style="font-size: 14.6667px;"> an answer within 24 hours. </span></strong></li>

<p><br />In certain situations, members of Aetna Medicare Premier (PPO) may be eligible to end their membership at other times of the year. This is known as a <strong>Special Enrollment Period.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Who is eligible for a Special Enrollment Period? </strong>If any of the following situations apply to you, you may be eligible to end your membership during a Special Enrollment Period. These are just examples, for the full list you can contact the plan, call Medicare, or visit the Medicare website (<a href="https://www.medicare.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.medicare.gov</a>):</li>
<ul>
<li>Usually, when you have moved.</li>
<li>If you have Medicaid.</li>

<li>If you are eligible for “Extra Help” with paying for your Medicare prescriptions.</li>

<li>If we violate our contract with you.</li>
<li>If you are getting care in an institution, such as a nursing home or long-term care (LTC) hospital.</li>
 
<li>Note: If you’re in a drug management program, you may not be able to change plans. Chapter 5, Section 10 tells you more about drug management programs.</li>
</ul>
<li><strong>When are Special Enrollment Periods?</strong> The enrollment periods vary depending on your situation.</li>
<li><strong>What can you do?</strong> To find out if you are eligible for a Special Enrollment Period, please call Medicare at 1-800-MEDICARE (1-800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users call 1-877-486-2048. If you are eligible to end your membership because of a special situation, you can choose to change both your Medicare health coverage and prescription drug coverage. This means you can choose any of the following types of plans:
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
<li>Another Medicare health plan. (You can choose a plan that covers prescription drugs or one that does not cover prescription drugs.)</li>
<li>Original Medicare <em>with</em> a separate Medicare prescription drug plan.</li>
<li><em>– or –</em> Original Medicare <em>without</em> a separate Medicare prescription drug plan.</li>

<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li><strong>If you receive “Extra Help” from Medicare to pay for your prescription drugs:</strong> If you switch to Original Medicare and do not enroll in a separate Medicare prescription drug plan, Medicare may enroll you in a drug plan, unless you have opted out of automatic enrollment.<br /><br /><strong>Note:</strong> If you disenroll from Medicare prescription drug coverage and go without creditable prescription drug coverage for a continuous period of 63 days or more, you may have to pay a Part D late enrollment penalty if you join a Medicare drug plan later. (“Creditable” coverage means the coverage is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage.) See Chapter 1, Section 5 for more information about the late enrollment penalty.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>When will your membership end?</strong> Your membership will usually end on the first day of the month after your request to change your plan is received.</li>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
<p>We have the right and responsibility to collect for covered Medicare services for which Medicare is not the primary payer. According to CMS regulations at 42 CFR sections 422.108 and 423.462, Aetna Medicare Premier (PPO), as a Medicare Advantage Organization, will exercise the same rights of recovery that the Secretary exercises under CMS regulations in subparts B through D of part 411 of 42 CFR and the rules established in this section supersede any State laws.</p>
<br />
<p>In some situations, other parties should pay for your medical care before your Medicare Advantage plan. In those situations, your Medicare Advantage plan may pay, but have the right to get the payments back from these other parties. Medicare Advantage plans may not be the primary payer for medical care you receive. These situations include those in which the Federal Medicare Program is considered a secondary payer under the Medicare Secondary Payer laws. For information on the Federal Medicare Secondary Payer program, Medicare has written a booklet with general information about what happens when people with Medicare have additional insurance. It’s called <em>Medicare and Other Health Benefits: Your Guide to Who Pays First (publication number 02179).</em> You can get a copy by calling 1-800-MEDICARE, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, or by visiting the <a href="http://www.medicare.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.medicare.gov</a> website.</p>
<br />
<p>The Plan’s rights to recover in these situations are based on the terms of this health plan contract, as well as the provisions of the federal statutes governing the Medicare Program. Your Medicare Advantage plan coverage is always secondary to any payment made or reasonably expected to be made under:</p>
<ul>
<li>A workers’ compensation law or plan of the United States or a State,</li>
<li>Any non-fault-based insurance, including automobile and non-automobile no-fault and medical payments insurance,</li>
<li>Any liability insurance policy or plan (including a self-insured plan) issued under an automobile or other type of policy or coverage, and</li>
<li>Any automobile insurance policy or plan (including a self-insured plan), including, but not limited to, uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since your Medicare Advantage plan is always secondary to any automobile no-fault (Personal Injury Protection) or medical payments coverage, you should review your automobile insurance policies to ensure that appropriate policy provisions have been selected to make your automobile coverage primary for your medical treatment arising from an automobile accident.</p>
<br />
<p>As outlined herein, in these situations, your Medicare Advantage plan may make payments on your behalf for this medical care, subject to the conditions set forth in this provision for the plan to recover these payments from you or from other parties. Immediately upon making any conditional payment, your Medicare Advantage plan shall be subrogated to stand in the place of all rights of recovery you have against any person, entity or insurer responsible for causing your injury, illness or condition or against any person, entity or insurer listed as a primary payer above.</p>
<br />
<p>In addition, if you receive payment from any person, entity or insurer responsible for causing your injury, illness or condition or you receive payment from any person, entity or insurer listed as a primary payer above, your Medicare Advantage plan has the right to recover from, and be reimbursed by you for all conditional payments the plan has made or will make as a result of that injury, illness or condition.</p>
<br />
<p>Your Medicare Advantage plan will automatically have a lien, to the extent of benefits it paid for the treatment of the injury, illness or condition, upon any recovery whether by settlement, judgment or otherwise. The lien may be enforced against any party who possesses funds or proceeds representing the amount of benefits paid by the Plan including, but not limited to, you, your representatives or agents, any person, entity or insurer responsible for causing your injury, illness or condition or any person, entity or insurer listed as a primary payer above.</p>
<br />
<p>By accepting benefits (whether the payment of such benefits is made to you or made on your behalf to any health care provider) from your Medicare Advantage plan, you acknowledge that the plan’s recovery rights are a first priority claim and are to be paid to the plan before any other claim for your damages. The plan shall be entitled to full reimbursement on a first-dollar basis from any payments, even if such payment to the plan will result in a recovery to you which is insufficient to make you whole or to compensate you in part or in whole for the damages you sustained. Your Medicare Advantage plan is not required to participate in or pay court costs or attorney fees to any attorney hired by you to pursue your damage claims.</p>
<br />
<p>Your Medicare Advantage plan is entitled to full recovery regardless of whether any liability for payment is admitted by any person, entity or insurer responsible for causing your injury, illness or condition or by any person, entity or insurer listed as a primary payer above. The plan is entitled to full recovery regardless of whether the settlement or judgment received by you identifies the medical benefits the plan provided or purports to allocate any portion of such settlement or judgment to payment of expenses other than medical expenses. The Medicare Advantage plan is entitled to recover from any and all settlements or judgments, even those designated as for pain and suffering, non-economic damages and/or general damages only.</p>
<br />
<p>You, and your legal representatives, shall fully cooperate with the plan’s efforts to recover its benefits paid. It is your duty to notify the plan within 30 days of the date when notice is given to any party, including an insurance company or attorney, of your intention to pursue or investigate a claim to recover damages or obtain compensation due to your injury, illness or condition. You and your agents or representatives shall provide all information requested by the plan or its representatives. You shall do nothing to prejudice your Medicare Advantage plan’s subrogation or recovery interest or to prejudice the plan’s ability to enforce the terms of this provision. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from making any settlement or recovery that attempts to reduce or exclude the full cost of all benefits provided by the plan.</p>
<br />
<p>Failure to provide requested information or failure to assist your Medicare Advantage plan in pursuit of its subrogation or recovery rights may result in you being personally responsible for reimbursing the plan for benefits paid relating to the injury, illness or condition as well as for the plan’s reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in obtaining reimbursement from you. For more information, see 42 U.S.C. § 1395y(b)(2)(A)(ii) and the Medicare statutes.</p>

<div class="TOCDescription">Explains key terms used in this booklet.</div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><u>Chapter 12. Definitions of important words<br /><br /></u></strong></span></div>
<strong>Ambulatory Surgical Center</strong> – An Ambulatory Surgical Center is an entity that operates exclusively for the purpose of furnishing outpatient surgical services to patients not requiring hospitalization and whose expected stay in the center does not exceed 24 hours.<br /><br /><strong>Annual Enrollment Period</strong> – A set time each fall when members can change their health or drug plans or switch to Original Medicare. The Annual Enrollment Period is from October 15 until December 7.<br /><br /><strong>Appeal</strong> – An appeal is something you do if you disagree with our decision to deny a request for coverage of health care services or prescription drugs or payment for services or drugs you already received. You may also make an appeal if you disagree with our decision to stop services that you are receiving. For example, you may ask for an appeal if we don’t pay for a drug, item, or service you think you should be able to receive. Chapter 9 explains appeals, including the process involved in making an appeal.<br /><strong><br />Balance Billing</strong> – When a provider (such as a doctor or hospital) bills a patient more than the plan’s allowed cost-sharing amount. As a member of Aetna Medicare Premier (PPO), you only have to pay our plan’s cost-sharing amounts when you get services covered by our plan. We do not allow providers to “balance bill” or otherwise charge you more than the amount of cost-sharing your plan says you must pay.<br /><br /><strong>Benefit Period</strong> – The way that both our plan and Original Medicare measures your use of skilled nursing facility (SNF) services. A benefit period begins the day you go into a hospital or skilled nursing facility. The benefit period ends when you haven’t received any inpatient hospital care (or skilled care in a SNF) for 60 days in a row. If you go into a hospital or a skilled nursing facility after one benefit period has ended, a new benefit period begins. There is no limit to the number of benefit periods.<br /><br /><strong>Brand Name Drug</strong> – A prescription drug that is manufactured and sold by the pharmaceutical company that originally researched and developed the drug. Brand name drugs have the same active-ingredient formula as the generic version of the drug. However, generic drugs are manufactured and sold by other drug manufacturers and are generally not available until after the patent on the brand name drug has expired.<br /><br /><strong>Catastrophic Coverage Stage</strong> – The stage in the Part D Drug Benefit where you pay a low copayment or coinsurance for your drugs after you or other qualified parties on your behalf have spent $7,050 in covered drugs during the covered year.<br /><br /><strong>Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)</strong> – The Federal agency that administers Medicare. Chapter 2 explains how to contact CMS.<br /><br /><strong>Coinsurance</strong> – An amount you may be required to pay as your share of the cost for services or prescription drugs after you pay any deductibles. Coinsurance is usually a percentage (for example, 20%).<strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>Combined Maximum Out-of-Pocket Amount</strong><span style="color: #262626; background-color: #ffffff;"> – This is the most you will pay in a year for all services from both network (preferred) providers and out-of-network (non-preferred) providers. See Chapter 4, Section 1.2 for information about your combined maximum out-of-pocket amount.<br /></span><strong><br />Complaint</strong> – The formal name for “making a complaint” is “filing a grievance.” The complaint process is used for certain types of problems <em>only</em>. This includes problems related to quality of care, waiting times, and the customer service you receive. See also “Grievance,” in this list of definitions.<br /><br /><strong>Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF)</strong> – A facility that mainly provides rehabilitation services after an illness or injury, and provides a variety of services including physical therapy, social or psychological services, respiratory therapy, occupational therapy and speech-language pathology services, and home environment evaluation services.<br /><br /><strong>Copayment (or “copay”)</strong> – An amount you may be required to pay as your share of the cost for a medical service or supply, like a doctor’s visit, hospital outpatient visit, or a prescription drug. A copayment is a set amount, rather than a percentage. For example, you might pay $10 or $20 for a doctor’s visit or prescription drug.<br /><strong><br />Cost-Sharing</strong> – Cost-sharing refers to amounts that a member has to pay when services or drugs are received. Cost-sharing includes any combination of the following three types of payments: (1) any deductible amount a plan may impose before services or drugs are covered; (2) any fixed “copayment” amount that a plan requires when a specific service or drug is received; or (3) any “coinsurance” amount, a percentage of the total amount paid for a service or drug that a plan requires when a specific service or drug is received. A “daily cost-sharing rate” may apply when your doctor prescribes less than a full month’s supply of certain drugs for you and you are required to pay a copayment. <strong><br /><br />Cost-Sharing Tier</strong> – Every drug on the list of covered drugs is in one of 5 cost-sharing tiers. In general, the higher the cost-sharing tier, the higher your cost for the drug.<br /><br /><strong>Coverage Determination</strong> – A decision about whether a drug prescribed for you is covered by the plan and the amount, if any, you are required to pay for the prescription. In general, if you bring your prescription to a pharmacy and the pharmacy tells you the prescription isn’t covered under your plan, that isn’t a coverage determination. You need to call or write to your plan to ask for a formal decision about the coverage. Coverage determinations are called “coverage decisions” in this booklet. Chapter 9 explains how to ask us for a coverage decision.<br /><br /><strong>Covered Drugs</strong> – The term we use to mean all of the prescription drugs covered by our plan. <br /><strong><br />Covered Services</strong> – The general term we use in this EOC to mean all of the health care services and supplies that are covered by our plan. <br /><br /><strong>Creditable Prescription Drug Coverage</strong> – Prescription drug coverage (for example, from an employer or union) that is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as Medicare’s standard prescription drug coverage. People who have this kind of coverage when they become eligible for Medicare can generally keep that coverage without paying a penalty, if they decide to enroll in Medicare prescription drug coverage later. <br /><br /><strong>Custodial Care</strong> – Custodial care is personal care provided in a nursing home, hospice, or other facility setting when you do not need skilled medical care or skilled nursing care. Custodial care is personal care that can be provided by people who don’t have professional skills or training, such as help with activities of daily living like bathing, dressing, eating, getting in or out of a bed or chair, moving around, and using the bathroom. It may also include the kind of health-related care that most people do themselves, like using eye drops. Medicare doesn’t pay for custodial care.<br /><strong><br />Daily Cost-Sharing Rate</strong> – A “daily cost-sharing rate” may apply when your doctor prescribes less than a full month’s supply of certain drugs for you and you are required to pay a copayment. A daily cost-sharing rate is the copayment divided by the number of days in a month’s supply. Here is an example: If your copayment for a one-month supply of a drug is $30, and a one-month’s supply in your plan is 30 days, then your “daily cost-sharing rate” is $1 per day. This means you pay $1 for each day’s supply when you fill your prescription. <br /><strong><br />Deductible</strong> – The amount you must pay for health care or prescriptions before our plan begins to pay.<br /><br /><strong>Disenroll or Disenrollment</strong> – The process of ending your membership in our plan. Disenrollment may be voluntary (your own choice) or involuntary (not your own choice).<br /><strong><br />Dispensing Fee</strong> – A fee charged each time a covered drug is dispensed to pay for the cost of filling a prescription. The dispensing fee covers costs such as the pharmacist’s time to prepare and package the prescription.<br /><strong><br />Durable Medical Equipment (DME)</strong> – Certain medical equipment that is ordered by your doctor for medical reasons. Examples include walkers, wheelchairs, crutches, powered mattress systems, diabetic supplies, IV infusion pumps, speech generating devices, oxygen equipment, nebulizers, or hospital beds ordered by a provider for use in the home. <br /><br /><strong>Emergency</strong> – A medical emergency is when you, or any other prudent layperson with an average knowledge of health and medicine, believe that you have medical symptoms that require immediate medical attention to prevent loss of life, loss of a limb, or loss of function of a limb. The medical symptoms may be an illness, injury, severe pain, or a medical condition that is quickly getting worse.<br /><br /><strong>Emergency Care</strong> – Covered services that are: (1) rendered by a provider qualified to furnish emergency services; and (2) needed to treat, evaluate, or stabilize an emergency medical condition.<br /><br /><strong>Evidence of Coverage (EOC) and Disclosure Information</strong> – This document, along with your enrollment form and any other attachments, riders, or other optional coverage selected, which explains your coverage, what we must do, your rights, and what you have to do as a member of our plan.<br /><br /><strong>Exception</strong> – A type of coverage decision that, if approved, allows you to get a drug that is not on your plan sponsor’s formulary (a formulary exception), or get a non-preferred drug at a preferred lower cost-sharing level (a tiering exception). You may also request an exception if your plan sponsor requires you to try another drug before receiving the drug you are requesting, or the plan limits the quantity or dosage of the drug you are requesting (a formulary exception).<br /><br /><strong>Extra Help</strong> – A Medicare program to help people with limited income and resources pay Medicare prescription drug program costs, such as premiums, deductibles, and coinsurance. <br /><br /><strong>Generic Drug</strong> – A prescription drug that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as having the same active ingredient(s) as the brand name drug. Generally, a “generic” drug works the same as a brand name drug and usually costs less.<br /><br /><strong>Grievance</strong> – A type of complaint you make about us or pharmacies, including a complaint concerning the quality of your care. This type of complaint does not involve coverage or payment disputes.<br /><strong><br />Home Health Aide</strong> – A home health aide provides services that don’t need the skills of a licensed nurse or therapist, such as help with personal care (e.g., bathing, using the toilet, dressing, or carrying out the prescribed exercises). Home health aides do not have a nursing license or provide therapy. <br /><br /><strong>Hospice</strong> – A member who has 6 months or less to live has the right to elect hospice. We, your plan, must provide you with a list of hospices in your geographic area. If you elect hospice and continue to pay premiums you are still a member of our plan. You can still obtain all medically necessary services as well as the supplemental benefits we offer. The hospice will provide special treatment for your state.<br /><br /><strong>Hospital Inpatient Stay</strong> – A hospital stay when you have been formally admitted to the hospital for skilled medical services. Even if you stay in the hospital overnight, you might still be considered an “outpatient.”<br /><br /><strong>Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA)</strong> – If your modified adjusted gross income as reported on your IRS tax return from 2 years ago is above a certain amount, you’ll pay the standard premium amount and an Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount, also known as IRMAA. IRMAA is an extra charge added to your premium. Less than 5% of people with Medicare are affected, so most people will not pay a higher premium.<br /><br /><strong>Independent Practice Associations (IPA)</strong> – Negotiate with insurers to provide services for insureds on a flat fee or retainer basis. They allow physicians to remain independent while still collaborating with other doctors to achieve best practices and negotiate with insurers as a group.<br /><br /><strong>Initial Coverage Limit</strong> – The maximum limit of coverage under the Initial Coverage Stage. <br /><br /><strong>Initial Coverage Stage</strong> – This is the stage before your “total drug costs including amounts you have paid and what your plan has paid on your behalf” for the year have reached $4,430.<br /><br /><strong>Initial Enrollment Period</strong> – When you are first eligible for Medicare, the period of time when you can sign up for Medicare Part A and Part B. For example, if you’re eligible for Medicare when you turn 65, your Initial Enrollment Period is the 7-month period that begins 3 months before the month you turn 65, includes the month you turn 65, and ends 3 months after the month you turn 65.<br /><br /><strong>In-Network Maximum Out-of-Pocket Amount</strong> – The most you will pay for covered services received from network (preferred) providers. After you have reached this limit, you will not have to pay anything when you get covered services from network providers for the rest of the contract year. However, until you reach your combined out-of-pocket amount, you must continue to pay your share of the costs when you seek care from an out-of-network (non-preferred) provider. See Chapter 4, Section 1.2 for information about your in-network maximum out-of-pocket amount.<br /><strong><br />List of Covered Drugs (Formulary or “Drug List”)</strong> – A list of prescription drugs covered by the plan. The drugs on this list are selected by the plan with the help of doctors and pharmacists. The list includes both brand name and generic drugs.<br /> <br /><strong>Low Income Subsidy (LIS)</strong> – See “Extra Help.”<br /><strong><br />Medicaid (or Medical Assistance)</strong> – A joint Federal and state program that helps with medical costs for some people with low incomes and limited resources. Medicaid programs vary from state to state, but most health care costs are covered if you qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid. See <strong>Addendum A</strong> at the back of this booklet for information about how to contact Medicaid in your state.<br /><strong><br />Medically Accepted Indication </strong>– A use of a drug that is either approved by the Food and Drug Administration or supported by certain reference books. See Chapter 5, Section 3 for more information about a medically accepted indication.<br /><br /><strong>Medically Necessary</strong> – Services, supplies, or drugs that are needed for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of your medical condition and meet accepted standards of medical practice.<br /><br /><strong>Medicare </strong>– The Federal health insurance program for people 65 years of age or older, some people under age 65 with certain disabilities, and people with End-Stage Renal Disease (generally those with permanent kidney failure who need dialysis or a kidney transplant). People with Medicare can get their Medicare health coverage through Original Medicare, a Medicare Cost Plan  or a Medicare Advantage Plan.<br /><br /><strong>Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period</strong> – A set time each year when members in a Medicare Advantage plan can cancel their plan enrollment and switch to another Medicare Advantage plan, or obtain coverage through Original Medicare. If you choose to switch to Original Medicare during this period, you can also join a separate Medicare prescription drug plan at that time. The Medicare Advantage Open Enrollment Period is from January 1 until March 31, and is also available for a 3-month period after an individual is first eligible for Medicare. <br /><br /><strong>Medicare Advantage (MA) Plan </strong>– Sometimes called Medicare Part C. A plan offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare to provide you with all your Medicare Part A and Part B benefits. A Medicare Advantage Plan can be an HMO, PPO, a Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plan, or a Medicare Medical Savings Account (MSA) plan. When you are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, Medicare services are covered through the plan, and are not paid for under Original Medicare. In most cases, Medicare Advantage Plans also offer Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage). These plans are called <strong>Medicare Advantage Plans with Prescription Drug Coverage</strong>.  Everyone who has Medicare Part A and Part B is eligible to join any Medicare Advantage health plan that is offered in their area.<br /><br /><strong>Medicare Cost Plan –</strong> A Medicare Cost Plan is a plan operated by a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) or Competitive Medical Plan (CMP) in accordance with a cost-reimbursed contract under section 1876(h) of the Act.<br /><strong><br />Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program </strong>– A program that provides discounts on most covered Part D brand name drugs to Part D members who have reached the Coverage Gap Stage and who are not already receiving “Extra Help.” Discounts are based on agreements between the Federal government and certain drug manufacturers. For this reason, most, but not all, brand name drugs are discounted. <br /><br /><strong>Medicare-Covered Services </strong>– Services covered by Medicare Part A and Part B. All Medicare health plans, including our plan, must cover all of the services that are covered by Medicare Part A and B. <br /><br /><strong>Medicare Health Plan</strong> – A Medicare health plan is offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare to provide Part A and Part B benefits to people with Medicare who enroll in the plan. This term includes all Medicare Advantage Plans, Medicare Cost Plans, Demonstration/Pilot Programs, and Programs of All-inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE). <br /><br /><strong>Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage (Medicare Part D) </strong>– Insurance to help pay for outpatient prescription drugs, vaccines, biologicals, and some supplies not covered by Medicare Part A or Part B. <br /><br /><strong>“Medigap” (Medicare Supplement Insurance) Policy </strong>– Medicare supplement insurance sold by private insurance companies to fill “gaps” in Original Medicare. Medigap policies only work with Original Medicare. (A Medicare Advantage Plan is not a Medigap policy.) <br /><br /><strong>Member (Member of our plan, or “Plan Member”) </strong>– A person with Medicare who is eligible to get covered services, who has enrolled in our plan, and whose enrollment has been confirmed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).<br /><br /><strong>Member Services </strong>– A department within our plan responsible for answering your questions about your membership, benefits, grievances, and appeals. See Chapter 2 for information about how to contact Member Services.<br /><br /><strong>Network </strong>– A group of doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care experts contracted by our plan to provide covered services to its members (see Chapter 1, Section 3.2). Network providers are independent contractors and not agents of our plan.<br /><strong><br />Network Pharmacy </strong>– A network pharmacy is a pharmacy where members of our plan can get their prescription drug benefits. We call them “network pharmacies” because they contract with our plan. In most cases, your prescriptions are covered only if they are filled at one of our network pharmacies. <br /><strong><br />Network Provider</strong> – “Provider” is the general term we use for doctors, other health care professionals, hospitals, and other health care facilities that are licensed or certified by Medicare and by the State to provide health care services. We call them <strong>“network providers”</strong> when they have an agreement with our plan to accept our payment as payment in full, and in some cases to coordinate as well as provide covered services to members of our plan. Our plan pays network providers based on the agreements it has with the providers or if the providers agree to provide you with plan-covered services. Network providers may also be referred to as “plan providers.”<br /><br /><strong>Non-Medicare Covered Services </strong>– Services that are not normally covered when you have Original Medicare. These are usually extra benefits you may receive as a member of a Medicare Advantage plan.<br /><br /><strong>Organization Determination </strong>– The Medicare Advantage plan has made an organization determination when it makes a decision about whether items or services are covered or how much you have to pay for covered items or services. Organization determinations are called “coverage decisions” in this booklet. Chapter 9 explains how to ask us for a coverage decision.<br /><br /><strong>Original Medicare (“Traditional Medicare” or “Fee-for-service” Medicare) </strong>– Original Medicare is offered by the government, and not a private health plan such as Medicare Advantage Plans and prescription drug plans. Under Original Medicare, Medicare services are covered by paying doctors, hospitals, and other health care providers payment amounts established by Congress. You can see any doctor, hospital, or other health care provider that accepts Medicare. You must pay the deductible. Medicare pays its share of the Medicare-approved amount, and you pay your share. Original Medicare has two parts: Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Part B (Medical Insurance) and is available everywhere in the United States.<br /><br /><strong>Out-of-Network Pharmacy </strong>– A pharmacy that doesn’t have a contract with our plan to coordinate or provide covered drugs to members of our plan. As explained in this <em>Evidence of Coverage,</em> most drugs you get from out-of-network pharmacies are not covered by our plan unless certain conditions apply. <br /><br /><strong>Out-of-Network Provider or Out-of-Network Facility </strong>– A provider or facility with which we have not arranged to coordinate or provide covered services to members of our plan. Out-of-network providers are providers that are not employed, owned, or operated by our plan or are not under contract to deliver covered services to you. Using out-of-network providers or facilities is explained in this booklet in Chapter 3.<br /><br /><strong>Out-of-Pocket Costs </strong>– See the definition for “cost-sharing” above. A member’s cost-sharing requirement to pay for a portion of services or drugs received is also referred to as the member’s “out-of-pocket” cost requirement.<br /><strong><br />Part C </strong>– see “Medicare Advantage (MA) Plan.”<br /><br /><strong>Part D </strong>– The voluntary Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program. (For ease of reference, we will refer to the prescription drug benefit program as Part D.)<br /><br /><strong>Part D Drugs</strong> – Drugs that can be covered under Part D. We may or may not offer all Part D drugs. (See your formulary for a specific list of covered drugs.) Certain categories of drugs were specifically excluded by Congress from being covered as Part D drugs.<br /><br /><strong>Part D Late Enrollment Penalty</strong> – An amount added to your monthly premium for Medicare drug coverage if you go without creditable coverage (coverage that is expected to pay, on average, at least as much as standard Medicare prescription drug coverage) for a continuous period of 63 days or more after you are first eligible to join a Part D plan. You pay this higher amount as long as you have a Medicare drug plan. There are some exceptions. For example, if you receive “Extra Help” from Medicare to pay your prescription drug plan costs, you will not pay a late enrollment penalty.<br /><br /><strong>Preferred Cost-Sharing</strong> – Preferred cost-sharing means lower cost-sharing for certain covered Part D drugs at certain network pharmacies.<br /><br /><strong>Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Plan</strong> – A Preferred Provider Organization plan is a Medicare Advantage Plan that has a network of contracted providers that have agreed to treat plan members for a specified payment amount. A PPO plan must cover all plan benefits whether they are received from network or out-of-network providers. Member cost-sharing will generally be higher when plan benefits are received from out-of-network providers. PPO plans have an annual limit on your out-of-pocket costs for services received from network (preferred) providers and a higher limit on your total combined out-of-pocket costs for services from both in-network (preferred) and out-of-network (non-preferred) providers.<br /><br /><strong>Premium</strong> – The periodic payment to Medicare, an insurance company, or a health care plan for health or prescription drug coverage. <br />
<div> </div>
<strong>Primary Care Provider (PCP)</strong> – Your primary care provider is the doctor or other provider you see first for most health problems. He or she makes sure you get the care you need to keep you healthy. He or she also may talk with other doctors and health care providers about your care and refer you to them. In many Medicare health plans, you must see your primary care provider before you see any other health care provider. See Chapter 3, Section 2.1 for information about Primary Care Providers.<br /><br /><strong>Prior Authorization</strong> – Approval in advance to get services or certain drugs that may or may not be on our formulary. In the network portion of a PPO, some in-network medical services are covered only if your doctor or other network provider gets “prior authorization” from our plan.  In a PPO, you do not need prior authorization to obtain out-of-network services. However, you may want to check with the plan before obtaining services from out-of-network providers to confirm that the service is covered by your plan and what your cost-sharing responsibility is. Covered services that need prior authorization are marked in the Benefits Chart in Chapter 4. Some drugs are covered only if your doctor or other network provider gets “prior authorization” from us. Covered drugs that need prior authorization are marked in the formulary. <br /><br /><strong>Prosthetics and Orthotics</strong> – These are medical devices ordered by your doctor or other health care provider. Covered items include, but are not limited to, arm, back and neck braces; artificial limbs; artificial eyes; and devices needed to replace an internal body part or function, including ostomy supplies and enteral and parenteral nutrition therapy.<br /><br /><strong>Quality Improvement Organization (QIO)</strong> – A group of practicing doctors and other health care experts paid by the Federal government to check and improve the care given to Medicare patients. See <strong>Addendum A</strong> at the back of this booklet for information about how to contact the QIO for your state. <br /><br /><strong>Quantity Limits</strong> – A management tool that is designed to limit the use of selected drugs for quality, safety, or utilization reasons. Limits may be on the amount of the drug that we cover per prescription or for a defined period of time. <br /><br /><strong>Rehabilitation Services</strong> – These services include physical therapy, speech and language therapy, and occupational therapy.<br /><br /><strong>Service Area </strong>– A geographic area where a health plan accepts members if it limits membership based on where people live. For plans that limit which doctors and hospitals you may use, it’s also generally the area where you can get routine (non-emergency) services. The plan may disenroll you if you permanently move out of the plan’s service area.<br /><br /><strong>Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Care</strong> – Skilled nursing care and rehabilitation services provided on a continuous, daily basis, in a skilled nursing facility. Examples of skilled nursing facility care include physical therapy or intravenous injections that can only be given by a registered nurse or doctor.<br /> <br /><strong>Special Enrollment Period</strong> – A set time when members can change their health or drug plans or return to Original Medicare. Situations in which you may be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period include: if you move outside the service area, if you are getting “Extra Help” with your prescription drug costs, if you move into a nursing home, or if we violate our contract with you. 
<p> </p>
<strong>Standard Cost-Sharing</strong> – Standard cost-sharing is cost-sharing other than preferred cost-sharing offered at a network pharmacy. <br /><br /><strong>Step Therapy</strong> – A utilization tool that requires you to first try another drug to treat your medical condition before we will cover the drug your physician may have initially prescribed.<br /><br /><strong>Supplemental Security Income (SSI)</strong> – A monthly benefit paid by Social Security to people with limited income and resources who are disabled, blind, or age 65 and older. SSI benefits are not the same as Social Security benefits.<br /><br /><strong>Urgently Needed Services</strong> – Urgently needed services are provided to treat a non-emergency, unforeseen medical illness, injury, or condition that requires immediate medical care. Urgently needed services may be furnished by network providers or by out-of-network providers when network providers are temporarily unavailable or inaccessible.
